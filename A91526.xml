            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not much above three years ſince a Sermon of mine was publiſhed by a good friend now with God, containing many of thoſe things which you will meet with in the firſt part of this Treatiſe which I put into your hands. It was judged uſefull by a very diſcerning per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that the Sermon ſhould receive ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements, and be made more comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; by whoſe advice and counſel I have been ruled to bring it into the form you now ſee, attended with ſuch additions as might more fully deſcribe the ſeveral kinds of falſe godlineſs that are among us. I am no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, but yet I can foreſee that I muſt not expect any other Readers then you; For they who love rather to <hi>talk</hi> of the Bible, then to <hi>underſtand</hi> it, and can content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſome ends and ſhreds of it, to
<pb facs="tcp:170332:4"/>make their ſpeech reliſh of Scripture phraſe, will lay theſe things aſide as dry and dull diſcourſes. But I have the confidence to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite thoſe whoſe underſtandings are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to any manly thoughts, and have a mind to be acquainted with the Counſels of God, to a peruſal of them; and hope that they will be not only acceptable, but delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to their meditation. And if they meet with any thing that is not for their preſent guſt, I deſire them that they would notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding read on to the concluſion, and by that time I may have converted their pallate to another taſte.</p>
            <p>I cannot but wiſh that this Treatiſe may have as many <hi>Readers</hi> as many books of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſignificancy and uſe are obſerved to have. With which wiſh I am not inſpired by vain ambition, and deſire of popular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe: but by a great ſenſe which I feel my ſelf poſſeſſed withall of the weight and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of thoſe truths which are here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed. But it is no more then a wiſh; for I know the hearts of men are full of theſe things that I here ſpeak againſt, and the world hath ſo many things for them to do, that it will not give them time to be ſerious. If any ſhallow and ſuperficial diſcourſe be preſented to them, which ſhall only bid them <hi>believe,</hi> and then ſhall comfort them with the <hi>priviledges</hi> of the Saints; it will go down eaſily, and needs but little chewing.
<pb facs="tcp:170332:4"/>But that which ſearches deep, eſpecially ſo low as the heart, and tends to the mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all carnal affections and paſſions that are there, is too laborious, and too unpleaſing alſo for them to meddle withall.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not tell you how much I believed that which is now come to paſs in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, when I conceived (a great while ago) theſe meditations; becauſe my private thoughts are not ſo conſiderable as that they ſhould be communicated to the world. Nor will I add any thing more by way of preface, but only theſe three ſhort Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that the reaſon of ſome ſad complaints that you will meet withall in the diſcourſe, is, becauſe it was all written (except the laſt chapter) before the <hi>Kings Majeſty</hi> was happily reſtored to his heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary dominions. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> that I have written moſt againſt that ſort of hypocriſie which was in faſhion, and leaſt againſt that which was worn out of date, which none will judge to be <hi>partiality</hi> in me, but Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Charity,</hi> which beſtows moſt of its la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours where there is moſt need. And <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> that the Sermon annexed was thought fit meerly for kindreds ſake to bear theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers company. But they are not more of kin to each other, then both of them are to your ſouls, and therefore let me ſay to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one as <hi>Solomon</hi> doth, <hi>Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine
<pb facs="tcp:170332:5"/>heart Say unto Wiſdom Thou art my Siſter, and call <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding thy kinſwoman.</hi>

But the ſinners in the mean time are tickled with their own life-blood, and laugh as mad men do when they are making away with themſelves, till their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons can be delivered from the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of thoſe carnal imaginations, that like ſo many Devils have got poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of them. As a man that is in an hot purſuit of his deſired conqueſts and ſpoils, doth not feel the ſmart of his wounds, till he come to be cold, and have the ſpirits ſetled in his blood: So is it with a ſinner, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives not the wide breaches, and the gaping wounds that ſin makes in his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170332:6"/>ſoul, nor complains of any grief and pain that it creates him, while he is in an eager chaſe of his beloved luſts, till he hath done his fierce purſuit, and in cool thoughts quietly reflects upon his folly. And when he is (as we ſay) in his cold blood, not enraged with his paſſions, nor pricked forward by the heat of his burning affections, he ſees that every ſin which he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted gave a ſlaſh to his ſoul, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a door to let out his precious life. Then, as the wounded man calls for a Chirurgion, and is as impatient for ſomething to lenifie and aſſwage the pricking of his ſore, as before he was to run into the encounter: ſo is the ſinner deſirous that ſome applications may be made for his cure, and that ſome balſam may be found out for to give him healing, which will be more grateful to him then all the pleaſures of his ſinful enjoyments.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All this you may eaſily ſee ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, not only in particular perſons,<note place="margin">Iſa. 57.5.</note> but in whole Nations. When <hi>Judah inflamed themſelves with idols,</hi> and was ſo <hi>mad</hi> upon them (as another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170332:7"/>ſaith of <hi>Babylon,</hi> Jer. 50.38.) that they burnt with filthy deſires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoſe ſpiritual adulteries, <hi>and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed themſelves even unto hell:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ver. 9.</note> It was but a ſport unto them, and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered not of what a deadly diſeaſe they laboured. As <hi>Tholoſanus</hi> calls a diſeaſe <hi>diſſolutio foederis in corpore,</hi> the diſſolution of the covenant or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is in the body; the ſetting of the parts at odds one with another: So we may ſay of all ſin, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Idolatry, that it is a breach of the peace with God, a renouncing of the Covenant that is between us, a proclaiming of open war with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And yet for all this, thoſe mad ſinners uſed to cry Peace, Peace, to themſelves (as the Prophets frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tell us) when there was no Peace at all.<note place="margin">ver. 10.</note> Though <hi>they had quite wearied themſelves in the greatneſs of their way; yet they ſaid not there is no hope: i. e.</hi> by following ſo many lovers, they were become like an harlot, <hi>laſſata ſed non ſatiata;</hi> tired, but not ſatisfied. They did not ſay (as the vulgar Latine ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it) <hi>Quieſcam,</hi> I will reſt, I will
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170332:7"/>ceaſe all this toil and labour, whereby comes no good, but much hurt to me. But when God had let them blood, to take down their inflammation, &amp; made them feel the ſmart of their ſins by many ſharp judgements, then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to <hi>roar like bears, and to mourn ſore like doves;</hi> then they ſaid, <hi>their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsions were with them; and as for their iniquities, they did know them;</hi> as you may read in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. v. 11, 12. When the whole head was ſick, and the whole heart was faint, when there was as many ſores as parts, and their body was one great wound;<note place="margin">Iſa. 1.5, 6.</note> then they cry as ſo many <hi>Lazars</hi> for the balm of <hi>Gilead,</hi> and ſay with <hi>Jeremy, Heal me O Lord, and I ſhall be healed; ſave me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 17.14.</note> 
                  <hi>and I ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But as there are many Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks that pretend at a two-penny charge to give ſoveraign balſams for all wounds; and for as much more to cure I know not how many deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate diſeaſes: So are there Phyſitians of no value, that undertake the cure of ſick ſouls by merry company, pleaſant books, faſting from their ſins
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170332:8"/>for a day or two, or by ſome ſuch trifle; and to reſtore the collapſed ſtrength of a ſick Nation by their politick receipts, their changes of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, their craft in managing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and an hundred ſuch little and feeble devices.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now when both the one and the other ſee that theſe are but delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive wayes of continuing our mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, then they begin to ask after the method of the great Phyſitian, and to enquire what God would have them do, that they may be healed. But then as moſt men would be willingly healed of their wounds without any ſearching or launcing of them, and are contented if they be palliated and skinned over, though they will break out again, either there or in ſome other place: And as they are for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward applications, but cannot imagine that the cleanſing of the inward parts by purging phyſick to carry away bad humours, ſhould conduce much to a cure: So likewiſe it is with ſinful men, they are loth to have their hearts throughly ſearched, and ſuch
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170332:8"/>ſevere and ſharp medicines that will eat away all the dead fleſh, all their baſe luſts and deſires, applyed: but they love ſmooth and oily things, that will mitigate the pains and aſſwage the grief, and flatter them into a meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of a cure. They would not have the inward and more latent cauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, nor the foulneſs of their ſouls medled withall; but they content themſelves with an outward amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and deſire only that the lips of their wound may be cloſed, that they may not cry out againſt them. A plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the blood of Chriſt they can well like that ſhall be clapt upon their ſore, and cool the rage and anger of their conſcience; but to be purified and refined by the Spirit of burning and judgement, is a way of healing that they are not willing to ſubmit unto. They would have a robe of Chriſts righteouſneſs caſt over them that ſhould hide the rottenneſs and putrefaction of their wounds; but his righteouſneſs in them which ſhould recover their health, and reſtore them to ſoundneſs, is a thing far from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170332:9"/>their deſires, if not from their thoughts.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But ſuppoſing that men are willing to undergo any thing for a cure, and fall into the hands of honeſt Phyſitians alſo; yet it is poſſible that they may not underſtand the whole cauſe of the diſtemper, and ſo apply but imperfect remedies, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter medicines proper but for one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular affect: By which means the diſeaſe may not only continue, but be increaſed, and turn into a worſe. For ſo it happens to many ſouls, who begin to think their condition is very bad, and reſolve for to amend, they are put upon the practice of ſome Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous duties, and are followed moſt with ſuch advices that make them think theſe are ſufficient to work their amendment. They eaſily imagine, that if they can but weep when they pray or hear a Sermon, thoſe tears have a rare faculty to waſh, ſupple and cleanſe all their ſinful wounds. But while they uſe not all Chriſts preſcriptions, they fall into a more dangerous diſtemper, and the hardeſt of all to be cured.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170332:9"/>The ſore eats deeper, the heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes rotten and unſound, &amp; makes a man to labour with <hi>hypocriſie,</hi> of which few do ever recover. And ſo it is likewiſe with politick bodies; the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions which ſeem moſt notorious in the eyes of the preſent Governors, are commonly lamented, and in ſome degree reformed; but then under the comfortable ſhadow of that reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a thouſand other ſins walk ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely, and enjoy their freedom and protection, from having any hands laid upon them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſtate of our Nation is at preſent ſo very ſick and weak, and ſo deſirous now we are of a cure; and yet ſo willing to have our hurt healed ſlightly, that the moſt ordinary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding can apply what hath been ſaid unto its caſe and condition. Our ſins have brought us down under a great number of diſeaſes, and laid us upon a bed of affliction. Great gaps are made in our body, our bones are broken and ſore vexed; the laſt drop of our vital blood is ready to iſſue forth. If I ſhould but repreſent
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170332:10"/>to you, how the treaſures of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are exhauſted (which Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men call its blood and ſpirits) it would make any heart ake, to ſee how pale and wan we look, without any colour in our cheeks. But beſides that Trading is <hi>dead,</hi> Juſtice alſo is ſore maimed; Charity and Love is broken; Piety is diſmembered; the very frame of our Government is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved; and a whole deluge of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries threaten to flow in at theſe wide breaches.<note place="margin">Jer. 8.15, 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Long have we looked for peace, but no good comes; and for a time of health, but behold trouble.</hi> Is there no Balm for ſuch wounds as ours? Is there no Phyſitian in the Engliſh Nation? Why then is not the health of it before this time recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</p>
               <p>Whether we have not tampered too much with State-Doctors, who ſought by meer power and worldly policy to ſettle our diſcompoſures, I leave to every ſerious man to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And whether we have not been backward to take the advice of our ſpiritual Phyſitians, and to follow
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170332:10"/>their directions, is a thing that may be ſoon determined. That which I ſhall enquire into, ſhall be this, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther even among the ſpiritual Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſome have not been ſought unto, who conſidered not the chief cauſe of our maladies, but applyed thoſe things moſt unto us, which did acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally feed our diſeaſes, and make them to be more dangerous. And ſo we ſhall find out what will compleatly remedy all our evils, and reſtore us to an healthy conſtitution again.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Now in this matter, I know not how to take a better courſe, then to imitate Phyſitians, who conſult not meer reaſon, but likewiſe the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of former times. And where they find the ſame ſymptoms, and all indications of a diſeaſe, which an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Author hath deſcribed, though many hundred years ago, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the ſame remedies and medicines are to be uſed, which are conſigned to them by his <hi>Probatum eſt.</hi> I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſearch into the records of divine Hiſtory, and obſerve what the ſtate of the Jews uſed to be, and what method
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170332:11"/>they were wont to take for the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Nation, when any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick calamity did befall them; and as Phyſitians truly ſay, <hi>Curatio indicat morbum;</hi> by their cure we ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know what their diſeaſe was; and give a gueſs alſo at our own, both diſeaſe and remedy. But many ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual applications there were, which the holy Writ takes notice of, and therefore I ſhall divide my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe into two parts, and <hi>firſt</hi> ſhew you what things were not of ſufficient vertue to cure them, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they were good and healing. And <hi>ſecondly</hi> what God did particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly direct them unto, for a perfect recovery of their ſtrength when it was decayed, and a binding up of their wounds when they were ſorely bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>

The neglect, or rather hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical obſervance of which <hi>Sabbath,</hi> or day of reſt, is reproved very ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the 58. of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> through the whole Chapter. Where by Sabbath, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. is to be underſtood <hi>this faſting day, on the tenth day of the ſeventh moneth,</hi> and not the ſeventh day of the week, as will appear to him that will take the pains to compare that Chapter, with thoſe places in <hi>Leviticus</hi> juſt now cited. But as there were many occaſional Faſts which pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men kept as they had need; and as there was no moneth in the year (if we may believe the Hebrew Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar) wherein they did not obſerve ſome ſtated Faſts in remembrance of ſome ſad things that had befaln that Nation in former times; and as the ſecond and fifth dayes of every week were Faſting dayes for Religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (which the Phariſee boaſts that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170332:13"/>he obſerved, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.12.) So in conformity to this uſual practice, their Rulers did appoint four Faſts to be ſolemnly obſerved every year, which are all mentioned together, <hi>Zach.</hi> 8.19. and were in remembrance (as both antient and modern, Chriſtian and Jewiſh Interpreters conjecture) of ſo many ſeveral remarkables in their ruine. The <hi>Faſt of the fourth moneth</hi> was in memory of the <hi>firſt breach made in the wall of Jeruſalem</hi> by the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans, of which we read, <hi>Jer.</hi> 52.6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Faſt of the fifth</hi> in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the <hi>burning of the Temple,</hi> which in that moneth happened, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 52.12.) as the burning of the ſecond Temple by <hi>Titus</hi> did alſo. That <hi>of the ſeventh</hi> was in memory of the <hi>ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Gedaliah</hi> by <hi>Iſmael,</hi> of which we read, <hi>Jer.</hi> 41. And that <hi>of the tenth</hi> was either in memory of the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſiege, which proved to be ſo fatal to them, which fell out to be in that moneth, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 25.1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 52.3. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.1, 2. or elſe becauſe in that moneth <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and they of the firſt captivity had the news brought
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170332:13"/>to them that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was taken, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.21. For I take it to be very frivolous which ſome of the Jews ſay, that the Faſt of the <hi>fourth</hi> moneth was kept, becauſe in it <hi>Moſes</hi> broke the Tables of ſtone; and the Faſt of the <hi>fifth,</hi> becauſe in it they were prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go from <hi>Kadeſh-Barnea,</hi> which was the ſhorteſt way to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> &amp;c. There being no reaſon then for to be given, why they ſhould not have been ſtill obſerved, after they came out of captivity; whereas the people were in doubt (as we ſhall ſee preſently) whether they ſhould keep theſe <hi>Faſts</hi> any longer. But before I paſs any further, it will not be amiſs to take notice on what places in the Law they built this practice. And you read in <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.9. that if they were going to war with an enemy that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed them, they are bid <hi>to blow an alarm with Trumpets,</hi> and God would remember to ſave them. This they underſtand to be a command for <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming a Faſt,</hi> and calling Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies (See <hi>Joel</hi> 2.15.) that they might humble themſelves when they were
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170332:14"/>in diſtreſs, and turn Gods wrath away from them. And then becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.40. that in the Land of their captivity they ſhould confeſs <hi>their ſins, and the ſins of their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,</hi> they concluded (as <hi>Ainſworth</hi> there obſerves out of <hi>Maimony</hi>) that they ought to humble themſelves on certain dayes of the year, for the ſins and miſeries of their fore-fathers, as well as their own; and ſo they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed theſe Faſts which are here mentioned in <hi>Zachary</hi> for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now the people being returned out of that captivity after ſeventy years humiliation, they ſent their meſſengers to the Prieſts, to enquire whether they ſhould keep the Faſt of <hi>the fifth moneth</hi> any longer,<note place="margin">Zach. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3. And they not being able, it ſeems, to reſolve the Queſtion, came to this Prophet, as you may gather from <hi>ver.</hi> 5. where he ſpeaks not only to all the people, but the Prieſts alſo, in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this enquiry. The reaſon why they make mention of that Faſt only among all the four, was this; becauſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170332:14"/>the building of the Temple was now in hand, in memory of whoſe deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, this Faſt (as hath been ſaid) was obſerved; and ſo they might well think that the cauſe of that mourning was ceaſed, and they had reaſon rather to rejoyce. But before the Prophet comes to determine the caſe, and to tell them, that the dayes ſhould ſtill be obſerved, only with a change of them from <hi>Faſts</hi> into <hi>Feaſts</hi> (as it is <hi>chap.</hi> 8.19.) he gives them to underſtand what a true Faſt is, leſt afterwards their dayes of mirth ſhould be to no better purpoſe then their dayes of ſorrow; and leſt they ſhould think that ſuch humbling of themſelves had purchaſed their deliverance. And he tells them plainly, that they were much miſtaken, if they imagined that God had been ſerved by them in the fifth or ſeventh moneth either, any better then by their fore-fathers, whoſe Faſting is in the fore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed place (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.) undervalued and ſlighted, as unworthy of his leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard.

If you had beſtowed your time the quite contrary way, it had been as gratefull to me, as all your faſting dayes. This is the ſenſe of the Prophets ſharp anſwer, which being propoſed by way of queſtion, is a moſt peremptory and undenyable aſſertion, that they had not pleaſed him but themſelves, with all their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; for he appeals to their own conſciences, and makes them Judges in the caſe. Do you your ſelves now tell me (ſaith God) in your own ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thoughts, whether you can believe that not eating, weeping, howling, and ſuch like things, are faſting unto me? No, you have been told often enough of this, and it is not the firſt time that you have been informed of your duty in this particular. <hi>Nunquid non ſunt verba quae locutus eſt Dominus,</hi> &amp;c.

As a Phyſitian keeps his patient to a thin diet, and takes his ordinary food from his table, that he may ſtarve the ill humors; ſo did they think to work a cure upon their ſouls, and by meer faſting from corporal food, to make them well; Not conſidering that the faſt of the ſoul conſiſts in an abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from thoſe things that are hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to it, as the faſt of the body is the forbearance of ſuch meats as feed its diſeaſes.<note place="margin">

While they pined their bodies, they ſuffered their luſts, the body of ſin, to be fat and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking. While they took down their fleſh, and made their faces look thin; that which the Scripture calls fleſh, was luſty and ſtrong, pampered and high fed. Their Pride was not ſtarved, their big and ambitious thoughts were not taken down; their inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, covetous deſires were not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired; their luxurious appetites were not retrenched; nothing that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable in them was paired off, moderated or abated: No, all ſorts of ſins were never more nouriſhed and made more hungry and ravenous, then when faſting and its concomitants could in groſs the name and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Religion to themſelves.

This preſent genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath been ſo laborious and zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their publick and private, their weekly and monethly humiliations; that few ages can parallel them, either in ſins, or ſuch kind of ſorrows. We have blown the trumpet ſo loudly, and proclaimed Faſts ſo frequently, that we have <hi>made the world ring of them, and heaven</hi> (I fear) <hi>deaf with them.</hi> Seeing we intended no more by them, then what the Jews performed, they have proved but like the vulgar medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines which people take from their neighbours in bodily diſeaſes, that leave them as ſick as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if not in a far worſe condition.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170332:18"/>and like to die by their Religion. They could not be more licentious and intemperate in their deſires then they are, if they had done all this pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance on purpoſe to purchaſe a licence to live as they liſt. And having their hearts ſo leavened with Jewiſh ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, they had as good have gone and made a feaſt, invited their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and paſſed that time away mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, which they ſpent only upon a ſad ceremony. For if we conſider the meer ſimple act either of the one, or the other of theſe things, they have no goodneſs in them: but as they are deſigned by us to certain purpoſes which are good, ſo they become acts of Religion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And then faſting from food is good and profitable, when it works upon our ſouls, as Phyſick doth upon our bodies, purging out the foul hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, making us clean, and rendring us fit for action and employment. And <hi>firſt in reſpect of the time paſt,</hi> it is to be uſed as an act of ſorrow and grief for our ingratitude; and our emptineſs ſhould make us feel, that all our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170332:19"/>come from Gods fulneſs. It ſhould teſtifie our anger and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt our ſelves, and be an act of revenge upon our ſelves for the abuſe of thoſe good things which God hath given us leave to feed on to our refreſhment, but which we have fatted our ſelves withall to an exceſſive ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and wantonneſs. We ſhould make it an expreſſion of our repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and diſclaiming of our former courſes; an acknowledgement that we deſerve not a mouth full of meat, but rather to have our daily bread ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from our tables, and not ſo much as the ſcraps and fragments of that plenteous proviſion left behind, which God bleſſes our Tables withall. And when it looks back with ſuch an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere countenance upon our inordinate enjoyments; when it confeſſes our unworthineſs, chides our unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, afflicts and chaſtiſes us for our former follies; then there is ſome good in it, and this ſoure ſauce may make us hereafter reliſh all divine bleſſings better. But this is not all the good it muſt do us; for if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170332:19"/>again to our former courſe, it is but a mock-repentance, and a glutton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous abſtinence. For it is nothing but fulneſs, that makes ſome men faſt; and their faſting doth but prepare them for the greater fulneſs.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And therefore <hi>ſecondly, in regard of the time to come,</hi> it is to be an act of mortification, deſigned to the ſtarving and pining of our luſts; to the cutting off their proviſion, and withdrawing of their nouriſhment; to the learning of ſobriety and temperate living; to the practiſing of ſelf-denyal in our appetites, and croſſing our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; and in ſhort, to the bringing the body into ſubjection, by taking away its provender, if it be an unruly beaſt that will not be governed. And ſo it is not a buſineſs of a day, or whoſe efficacy reaches but till night; but it hath a deſign upon the whole life, wherein we are to abſtain as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully from all exceſs in pleaſures, yea from all ſin, as we do on that day from all our food.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170332:20"/>of death; it being that which tends to the deſtruction of the body, and the taking away of its life. It ſhould not only ſignifie that we are dying to all earthly things, but it ought to be an inſtrument of death, to take away the life of our luſts. And when it is ſo uſed, as not to be a whet-ſtone to ſharpen our ſtomacks againſt the next meal; but to be a knife to cut and ſlaſh off all the immoderation of our appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, to wound and kill all our ſins; it is a thing very acceptable to God, and hugely ſerviceable to our ſouls.

All this, I ſay, ſignified nothing to God, but that they were miſerable; for alas, the deep and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſorrow for ſin, the mourning of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170332:25"/>their ſouls after God, the rending and tearing of their hearts; the dof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing off all the fine gay cloathing, wherein their hearts ſecretly prided themſelves; the uncaſing and ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of their ſouls of all their cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, wherein they hid and kept warm many beloved ſins; the laying ſome grating conſiderations as cloſe to their hearts, as ſack-cloth was to their fleſh; the pouring ſhame and reproach upon themſelves; the bluſhing to look up unto the face of God with any confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, till they were peremptorily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved (againſt all impediments) to be better; the trembling proſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at his feet; the fulneſs of grief that makes the heart unable to ſpeak a word for it ſelf; theſe things they were ſtrangers unto. And therefore the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> cryes out, <hi>cap.</hi> 58.4, 5. <hi>Is this the Faſt that I have choſen, a day for a man to afflict his ſoul? is it to bow down his head as a bulruſh, and to ſpread ſack-cloth and aſhes under him? wilt thou call this a faſt, and an accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able day to the Lord?</hi> No, <hi>rend your hearts and not your garments</hi> (ſaith the

               <p n="3">3. Then tears are good, when they are the companions of a relenting and returning heart; when they run out of a ſoul that is running towards God. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.2, 3. <hi>All the houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>lamented after the Lord, and</hi> Samuel <hi>ſpake unto them, ſaying, If you return unto the Lord with all your heart, then put away the ſtrange gods, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your heart to the Lord, and ſerve him only, and he will deliver you.</hi> That is, if you be in good earneſt, let us ſee ſomething elſe beſide your weeping and lamentation; and if theſe be the outward expreſſions of the in ward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting of your hearts, then put away all thoſe diſpleaſing things that have created you ſo much miſchief, and coſt you now ſo many tears. Away with all theſe ſins that are ſuch offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to your ſelves as well as unto God. Thruſt not theſe needles any more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your heart, theſe thorns into your eyes; carry them all away in this flood of tears. Tears are no further
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170332:26"/>liked of God, then as they are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of a ſerious inward grief and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, which is fed and nouriſhed even by our reaſons, and have their ſpring in the deepeſt conſiderations. And then only are they expected from us, when we uſe to weep in other caſes of ſadneſs, and upon dolefull accidents. If that be our temper, to weep bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly when ſome mournful object pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it ſelf to us, wherein we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; it is a ſad ſign to ſee our eyes dry, when the deplorable condition of our ſouls doth lie before us. But if our ſorrow uſeth to expreſs it ſelf ſome other way in ſuch caſes, then that is all the outward token that God requires in this. Yet let it be what it will, God will not accept of it, unleſs it amount to a great diſpleaſure againſt our ſelves; baſe thoughts of our ſelves, that have committed ſuch acts; a huge trouble in our mind for what is paſt; hearty wiſhes that all were undone; ſenſe of our obnoxiouſneſs to Gods diſpleaſure; humble and earneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts to be received into his favour. Which laſt thing, if it be true, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170332:26"/>with our remaining in a ſtate of ſin, and therefore this ſorrow goes a great deal further, and includes in it an hatred of ſin; a reſolution never more to have to do with it; a chuſing rather to die then willingly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſuch another act: An actual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining of it; a ſetting of our ſelves to reſiſt the next temptation; a pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of a watch over our ſelves; and in every thing, ſuch a temper as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be quiet in the condition it is, but which muſt be better. If we find not our ſelves in this poſture, all our tears are no better then puddle water, our ſighs but the reek of a dunghill, our tearing of our hair but a fit of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, our mourning but the noiſe of wolves; and there is not ſo much as the beginning of that work in us which God looks for when we faſt, and weep, and call after him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And it will not be amiſs to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what cheap and eaſie things tears are, before we paſs any further. Firſt, there are ſome weeping tempers and diſpoſitions; hearts ſo ſoft and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170332:27"/>tender, ſo full of moiſture, that they have a flood of tears for any occaſion. The breaking of a glaſs, the loſs of the leaſt thing that they love, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind word, the croſſing of their wills in the ſmalleſt trifle, will make ſome hearts burſt forth into them. And therefore eaſie, and ſoft natures, have little reaſon to lay any weight upon them. And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> you know that ſtones will be moiſt, and weep in foul weather. In a great danger, or when ſome ſad judgement is upon them, the hardeſt and moſt marble hearts may begin to relent and bedew themſelves with tears. When men have diſmal and black apprehenſions of a tempeſt that rattles in their ears; when they have a ſound of Gods wrath that comes and amazes them with its fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full noiſe; it may make them ſhrike and cry out, and it may ſqueeze ſome ſad groans from them, which may end in tears. Nay <hi>thirdly,</hi> tears being bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily things, they are many times ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er cauſed by bodily calamities, then by a ſenſe of ſpiritual concernments. We may weep for the harm that ſin hath
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170332:27"/>done us, when we think it is for the wrong that we have done to God. The loſs of our health or goods may moſt trouble us, and not the loſs of God and our ſouls. The diſcredit ſin hath brought upon our name, may more affect us, then the diſhonour that thereby we have caſt upon our Maker. And ſo while men think that they weep for ſin, and that Gods name ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, they do but pour out their own private grief, &amp; lament their own ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. As the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (whom <hi>Zach.</hi> ſpeaks of, and whoſe caſe we are ſtating) might eaſily mourn and weep all the ſeventy years, if it had been but to think of the great calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that had befaln them. The ruine of their City, the burning of their Temple, the captivity of their Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the pouring out their blood like water, and ſundry doleful circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in all theſe might well make them wiſh with <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> cap. 9.1. <hi>that their head was waters, and their eyes a fountain of tears, that they might weep day and night for the ſlain of the daughter of their people.</hi> But what is all this to a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170332:28"/>ſenſe of ſin, and a groaning under the intolerable burden of their iniquity! To what purpoſe are all theſe tears, if inward grief and anguiſh for ſin do not give them all their acrimony and ſmartneſs? if they waſh and ſcour not the ſoul from all its filth and naſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Or, <hi>fourthly,</hi> tears may be but ſome heat-drops, when men have a great ſenſe of ſome mercy, and the Sun ſhines very comfortably upon them: which though they are very great, and bigger then fall in more conſtant ſhowers, yet they are ſoon over, and all is fair again. Or, <hi>fifthly,</hi> they may be like the morning dews; ſome good moods when they are cool and ſober; a good fit as ſoon as they are up in a morning, and before they go into any company or employment. But in the heat of the day, and when a temptation comes, they are all lickt up, and no foot-ſtep of them remains. And it is well, if they become not more ſcorcht and dry by ſuch little moiſtures. Or, <hi>ſixthly,</hi> ſuppoſe that there be ſome preſent heavy ſenſe of ſin that makes them bigg with a cloud,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170332:28"/>and expreſs theſe briny tears; yet alas! they are but like a ſudden daſh of rain, which is ſoon paſſed over, and then all is clear again, until the next affectionate ſhowre. At the next meeting they entertain their ſins with as great a friendſhip and familiarity, as if there had never been any falling out, nor any unkindneſſes paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. And if after ſome em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces and new endearments, there happen again a new diſtaſt alſo; yet the reconcilement is eaſie, and a ſmall importunity will make them forget all the injuries their ſins have done <hi>them,</hi> and all the ill language that they have given their <hi>ſins.</hi> Such are the tears of many a man, who cozens himſelf into a conceit that he is a penitent; they are but the iſſue of a natural tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or the product of ſome ſharp affliction, or the over-flow of ſome ſudden paſſion, whoſe ſurges may ſwell by ſome outward as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cauſes. As a child while he is under the laſhes of the rod, makes a ſad face, &amp; waters his cheeks, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth loudly, but as ſoon as the boyes
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170332:29"/>come, goes to his play as merrily as ever again: So is it with many fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who are good no longer then they feel the ſmart; but ſmile upon their antient pleaſures, and waſh their faces in ſweet waters, which you would have thought ſhould never have been waſht with any thing but ſalt tears. Or as you ſee a young man who being in love with one much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, and therefore chidden by his Father, weeps like a little babe, and ſeems as if he would drown himſelf in the flood of his tears; but upon the very next ſight is as hot in his love, and as eager in his purſuit, as though there had been no ſuch cooler. So it is with many fond men, who in the abſence of thoſe creatures that they dote upon, and when they are under ſound reproofs from God for their follies, they weep as if they meant to leave themſelves no eyes to look upon them any more: But yet when thoſe objects ſhall happen to give them a kind greeting, they cannot forbear to anſwer the ſalutation with their uſual civility. And yet how much men
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170332:29"/>pleaſe themſelves in this tenderneſs of heart, is more apparent, then that I need ſpeak of it. They take this eaſineſs to be ſorrowful, to be a ſign of grace, and that their hearts are not hardened; when as they have the ſame eaſineſs to ſin, and are no harder to be wrought upon to conſent unto it. They will take this to be godly ſorrow, though it work no repentance and amendment, in ſpite of what the Scripture ſaith, and the cleareſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that can be offered. But I will ſpend no more time about thoſe who cozen themſelves with ſuch little things; for all that I can ſay will not convince them, unleſs they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider; and if they will, then half of what hath been ſaid will be ſufficient to convince them. And beſides, I would not either make this book ſwell to a great bulk (which I do not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect) or paſs over too lightly what I chiefly intend.</p>

THE tongue is a member that hangs ſo looſe, and is of ſuch ready motion, that when the heart is full of ſighs, and the eyes of tears, it is no difficult matter to draw this neighbour into their aſſiſtance, to tell a ſad ſtory, and to beg for ſome relief. And therefore in thoſe times of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn faſting and mourning, they uſed <hi>to make large confeſsions of their ſins, and pray to God for the pardon of them, and turning away of his wrath.</hi> Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Confeſſions, you may read the <hi>ninth</hi> Chapter of each of theſe three Books, <hi>Ezra, Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> where they ſpread before God the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170332:30"/>tranſgreſſions of the Nation, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their great demerits. And you may well think the people were not negligent in this piece of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, the mouth uſing to ſpeak when the ſoul is full of deſire to be eaſed of the burden that lies upon us. They brought (it is moſt likely) before God long catalogues of their own ſins, and of the provocations of their fore-fathers. They accuſed their Kings, Princes, Prophets, Prieſts, and all the people of the Land of many rebellions and treaſons againſt him. They charged themſelves liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with all manner of crimes againſt God and each other, and they ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to all the inditements which the Prophets of the Lord uſed to lay againſt them. They condemned and ſentenced themſelves before him, and acknowledged that all his judgements were righteous, and that they deſerved to ſuffer far worſe puniſhments, if he ſhould deal ſeverely with them. And yet this was nothing but an hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call talk to God, while they were in love with thoſe ſins that they did ſo
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170332:31"/>confeſs: and remained in a ſtate of reconciliation to thoſe ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, of which they ſtood there by their own conſciences arraigned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But though this kind of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might give themſelves good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, yet it gave God none at all. It is an eaſie matter for a man to rail at himſelf, while he thinks the better of himſelf for it. It puts a man to no great coſt or trouble to reckon up all his debts, if thereby he hope to get them all diſcharged. But God is not of our mind, and doth not like a man the better, becauſe he tells him he is a grievous ſinner, but far the worſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe againſt his conſcience he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues ſtill a ſinner: He is ſo far from finding a kind entertainment with God by theſe pretended ſubmiſſions, that he will rather meet with a frown, and this angry ſentence, <hi>Out of your own mouthes, O ye hypocritical traytors, ſhall you be condemned: and you ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, you your ſelves being Judges.</hi> For this is a moſt ridiculous piece of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantry, and as if we ſhould ſay to him, Lord! we are moſt miſerable
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170332:31"/>ſinners, moſt notorious offenders, and ſo we intend with thy good leave ſtill to continue. We have broken all thine holy Laws, and may we but do ſo ſtill, we will never diſown the act, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſadly acknowledge it. This Confeſſion ſignifies nothing elſe, but that men deſire they may do ſtill as they were wont to do, at no greater charge then again to confeſs it. They beg that the acknowledgements of their faults may procure leave to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the ſame again, with no greater trouble, but only to make a new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement. It ſpeaks only that they are ſinners, &amp; that they deſire the favour to be ſo ſtill, and they will not ſtick continually to make Confeſſion of it. Confeſſion is the condition of ſinning more freely in their Divinity; they disburden their conſciences by it, that they may lay on more load. As the mariners unlade the ſhip to take in new ſtowage, and as the drunkard vomits up his former draughts to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the merry meeting; ſo do men that are weary with ſinning, bring up all before God that troubles their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170332:32"/>that ſo under the ſeverity (as they imagine) of his pardon, they may fill themſelves again when they have a mind unto it. They think it not good manners to come to Gods Table ſmelling rankly of a debauch, and ſo againſt ſome ſuch high time, they may confeſs their ſins, as a means to cleanſe and purge their ſouls. Or their conſciences are griped, and their ſins make them ſick and ill at eaſe, and ſo they go to diſgorge themſelves (for by no better name can I call it) and make a relation of their caſe to the great Phyſitian. But then as many patients, if they hear but a word drop from the Phyſitians mouth, that their diſeaſe is not dangerous, but they may eaſily recover, will take no Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick at all, but throw away their Bills of advice; ſo if theſe ſinners can but hear one good promiſe, any merciful ſaying that gives men encouragement to hope, away they go with it in their mouthes, and with no amendment in their lives. And yet many times theſe Confeſſions come not from ſo high a cauſe, but owe their birth to meer
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170332:32"/>cuſtom and imitation, being as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as to ſay, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us, we are all ſinners;</hi> and <hi>God help us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But whatſoever men may mean by them, ſuch Confeſſions as theſe ſignifie nothing at all unto God. For the ſins that men rehearſe unto him, are all known by him before, and lie continually in his eyes. If this be all they have to ſay, that they are ſinners, and have committed ſuch and ſuch acts againſt him, they may as well let their tongues reſt in quiet; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new in all this. Then Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is ſignificant, when it is an act of ſhame and reproach to our ſelves, an act of grief and hatred, a diſavowing and diſclaiming for ever ſuch practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Now we ſay ſomething unto God; this is a new buſineſs; the caſe is quite altered; and there is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs with him for ſuch perſons. So the Apoſtle tels us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.9. <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs.</hi> Which is to the ſame ſenſe with that of the wiſe man,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170332:33"/>
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. <hi>He that confeſſeth his ſins, and forſaketh them, ſhall have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> And what <hi>Solomon prayes</hi> for in the behalf of ſuch ſupplicants, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.47, 48. God himſelf <hi>promiſes</hi> to them, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.14. as you may ſee, if you will take the pains to read the places. True confeſſion ſignifies that we are aſhamed and bluſh to look up unto heaven; that we have nothing to ſay for our ſelves, but much againſt them; that we cannot but cry out upon our own baſeneſs and falſneſs unto God, that we had rather not be, then do one ſuch vile act again; that we are grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and pained at the very heart, and cannot but give vent to our ſouls in ſighs and groans; that we cannot with patience think upon our ſelves, nor hold from proclaiming our own guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that we remember nothing with ſo much ſadneſs, as that we have been offenders; and that we reſolve by Gods aſſiſtance and our utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, to grow better, may we but be pardoned ſuch offences. It is begotten by a deep ſenſe of the nature of ſin, and the high affront which it puts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170332:33"/>on God. The ſoul is ſtounded with ſuch thoughts, and ſtruck with a ſtrange palſie and a fearful trembling, that it ſhould dare to adventure upon ſuch a contempt. The multitude of theſe depſperate acts makes it groan earneſtly for a deliverance from them. Every groan, every word grates upon the heart, as a file doth upon iron, which at every rub fetches off ſome of the ruſt. And the further it proceeds in ſuch Confeſſions, the more is all affection to ſin diminiſhed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now God loves ſuch a pungent ſorrow as pricks to the very heart, and gives a deadly wound to all our ſins. Such words are acceptable to him, as ſtrike like darts through the very life of our luſts, and nail them to the Croſs. He loves when we look upon him whom we have pierced, and mourn ſo bitterly, that our hearts are ſhot through with an incurable wound to the fleſh, and all the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and deſires thereof: And he loves ſuch a Confeſſion as expreſſes this ſorrow, this pain, and this torment of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170332:34"/>our hearts, which will be mixed with a vehement diſpleaſure and hatred, both againſt our ſelves and our ſins. This he loves more then all ſacrifices, or ſuch like gifts, whereby they thought many times to flatter him. And therefore the returning ſinners promiſe, as God bids them, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.2. <hi>that they will render the calves of their lips; i. e.</hi> as <hi>Kimchi</hi> interprets it, humble and penitent Confeſſions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſacrifices; for thou loveſt (ſaith he) the words of repentance beſt. And therefore he obſerves that the ſcape-goat, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.21. on which the wickedneſs of the children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> was laid, that he might carry them away, was not offered upon the Altar, but Confeſſion only was offered to God, which was far better. But then this Confeſſion of ours is to be, (1) with a promiſe never to do ſo any more; and (2) it is to be made good by actual forſaking of ſin; and (3) it is to be done preſently, in ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as we have been moſt guilty in. So we read in <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.7. and the Hebrew Doctors Comments upon it.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170332:34"/>The text ſaith, that in caſe of a treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, a man was to confeſs his ſin that he had done, and to make a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for any wrong by a full reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with ſome addition to it. And <hi>Maimon</hi> ſaith, the form of Confeſſion was this, <hi>O God, I have ſinned,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">V. <hi>Ainſw.</hi> in loc.</note> 
                  <hi>I have done perverſly, I have treſpaſſed before thee, and have done thus and thus; but lo I repent, and am aſhamed of my doings, and I will never do this thing again.</hi> And he ſaith, no atonement could be made for a man, no not when he had made ſatisfaction for the damage he had done his neighbour, <hi>till he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, and did promiſe to turn away from doing ſo again for ever.</hi> And therefore when <hi>Ezra</hi> exhorts the people to make Confeſſion unto the Lord God of their Fathers, he adds, <hi>and do his pleaſure, and ſeparate your ſelves from the people of the Land, and from the ſtrange wives, Ezra</hi> 10.11. And it may be added, that it is part of Gods will and pleaſure, that we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our faults one to another, as well as unto him, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. when the heart is truly humbled, it will be glad
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170332:35"/>of any wayes to ſhame it ſelf, or to make ſatisfaction to others that are offended, or to convince ſinners, that they may ceaſe to offend. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever volumes we bring againſt our ſelves, either before God, or others, without ſuch a ſenſe of ſin as I have deſcribed, it is but lying unto the Lord, and telling him hypocritical ſtories, which will remain as matter of new accuſation upon our account. We ſhall but more provoke and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe his anger againſt us, when we think for to avert it, and by our own breath, kindle a flame that will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour us.</p>

                     <hi>1.</hi> Prayer is another refuge they betook themſelves unto in their miſery. <hi>2.</hi> And ſo now men expect great things from it. <hi>3.</hi> But ſelf-love indites them. <hi>4.</hi> And mens love to their ſins makes non-ſenſe of them. <hi>5.</hi> For when they pray againſt ſin, they labour to uphold it. <hi>6.</hi> And ſo neither their own pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, nor the prayers of good men will prevail for them. <hi>7.</hi> What prayers are acceptable to God. <hi>8.</hi> And for what.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. IT is a ſaying aſcribed unto an Angel, in the book of <hi>Tobit,</hi> cap. 12. 8. that, <hi>Prayer is good with Faſting.</hi> And of this the people of the Jews had ſuch an opinion, that they never neglected it on thoſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn dayes, but thought that it could fetch down any bleſſings from heaven upon them. God himſelf commands, when he calls for a Faſt, that they ſhould cry unto him, <hi>Joel</hi> 1.14. This they uſed to do (ſaith the Book
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170332:36"/>of <hi>Judith</hi>) <hi>with great fervency, with earneſtneſs, with all their power, cap.</hi> 4. 9, 12, 15. And ſometimes (as is there expreſſed, <hi>cap.</hi> 6. 21.) they called on the God of <hi>Iſrael all night</hi> for help. Their hearts were even diſſolved into petitions. They ſeemed to be ſo far from ſtonineſs, that they were more yielding then fleſh, and could melt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to water. Their eyes could not flow with tears ſo plentifully, as their hearts did with prayers. For ſo in the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee thoſe words are paraphraſed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7 6. <hi>They drew water, and pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it out before the Lord; i. e.</hi> They poured out their hearts in ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And ſo now at this day, men are content to pump hard for as many buckets full of prayers, as will hold them pouring out from morning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til night. Devouter perſons the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens never ſaw, if this be to be Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. How can God chuſe but pour down his bleſſings on ſuch men, who are ſo free and open-hearted to him, and could be content to do nothing elſe but preſent him with ſuch ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170332:36"/>Prayer paſſing under ſuch a magnificent name as the <hi>Key of heavens Gate,</hi> and having thoſe Scriptures ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to it which ſpeak of <hi>having pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with God and prevailng,</hi> men think that by it they can do great matters, and place no ſmall confidence in its <hi>authority.</hi> So I call it, becauſe they are ready to apply thoſe words to its office, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.11. concerning the work of my hands <hi>command you me.</hi> Though good Interpreters (which I think fit to admoniſh the Reader of by the way) do read that verſe with an Interrogation to this ſenſe: <hi>Do you command me what I ſhall do, and ask me what I mean to deal ſo with my ſons, the people of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>who, I ſay, ſhall go into captivity?</hi> which agrees well with ver. 9, 10. <hi>Wo be to him that ſtrives with his maker,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Wo be to him that ſaith to his Father, What begetteſt thou?</hi> &amp;c. And as the words lie in our tranſlation, their meaning is only this, that they ſhould enquire of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and the reſt of his Prophets, concerning the future ſtate of their Nation, and bid them tell them what he was about
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170332:37"/>to do with them, from whom they ſhould receive good ſatisfaction, both of his Juſtice in their captivity, and his Mercy in ſending them deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which in that Chapter he is treating of. But ſo, I ſay, it is that men advance their prayers to ſuch a prerogative, that they have ingroſſed the name of Religion to themſelves, and they have learnt to call praying, <hi>going to duty,</hi> as if this were all, or the chief of what we have to do. And ſo if in their <hi>Confeſsions</hi> they ſhould be dejected and caſt down, yet their <hi>petitions</hi> are able to lift them up very high in hopes again. Eſpecially ſince ſome have taken this new way of boldneſs, to tell God in plain Engliſh, <hi>that he muſt not, that he cannot deny them, and that they will have audience, and that without any delay alſo.</hi> Which are no deviſed expreſſions of mine, but thoſe which ſome of name have uttered, and which their followers may be apt to imitate, as an high token of a zealous Faith. If any be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this plainneſs, it is their own fault that occaſion it, and they cannot
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170332:37"/>be more offended then many good ſouls are at their ſaucy language.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But it is now as it was then in another regard alſo; The prayers of the Jews were commonly to no other purpoſe, but <hi>that God would pardon them, turn again to them, and ſave their Nation from their enemies hands, whileſt they thought not of turning unto him, and putting all his enemies out of their ſouls.</hi> Nothing was ſadder to them, then to be in bondage and ſlavery, and therefore that made their hearts ſigh more then their ſins. Their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers differed from the deſires of good men, as the Mahometans <hi>Lords prayer</hi> from that of the Chriſtians. The laſt thing that we beg of God is, that no temptation may prevail over us, to make us fall again into thoſe ſins for which we beſeech forgiveneſs. But the Turks conclude that prayer, (which they call the prayer of Jeſus the Son of <hi>Mary</hi>) in this faſhion, <hi>Let not ſuch an one rule over me,</hi>

                  <hi>which will have no mercy on me, for thy mercies ſake, O thou moſt merciful.</hi> Self-love and ſenſe of miſery can indite good
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170332:38"/>ſtore of petitions, adorn them with eloquence, inſpire them with ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and thruſt them forward with a luſty degree of confidence. But as they ſay of ſome ſort of precious ſtones, that though they are of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign vertue, yet they loſe all their force, if they be put into a dead mans mouth: So it is with this Chriſtian Jewel, which doth wonders when it is it ſelf, but languiſhes and dies when it is in the mouth of unreformed ſinners. Such mens prayers are but a ſtinking breath, which is very offenſive to the noſtrils of God. They are ſo far from being a grateful voice unto him, that he turns away his ears from them, as we do from the braying of Aſſes, or the talk of fools. And therefore he tells the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.4.) <hi>that he would not have them faſt as they did, to cauſe their voice to be heard on high,</hi> not regarding either their mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful howlings, or their clarnorous pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, whereby they thought to ſtir him up to help them. And by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> he tells them (<hi>cap.</hi> 14. 12.) <hi>that when they faſt he will not
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170332:38"/>hear their cry. For he that turns away his ear from hearing the Law, even his prayer ſhall be an abomination,</hi> Prov. 28.9. If men will not hear God, he will not hear them, yea he cannot give ear unto them. For the things that they love and embrace, are ſuch neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary cauſes of the evils under which they groan, and ſo inconſiſtent with the mercies that they deſire, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs God alter the nature of things, or change the method of his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the government of the world, he cannot hearken to their petitions. Either he muſt change his mind, or they muſt change theirs, or their prayers be unanſwered. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unleſs they heartily renounce their ſins, and throughly diſcharge their iniquities, all their prayers for ſending mercies, and for removing miſeries, are a piece of meer non-ſenſe, incoherent ignorant ſtuff, which will be returned with ſuch ſhame upon them, as if he had thrown the dung of the ſacrifices in the face of thoſe that brought them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When men bear a love to thoſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170332:39"/>ſins, the evil conſequents of which they deſire may be prevented, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied, that they may not ruine them, they are as ridiculous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful, as if a man ſhould beg health while he continues in his riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and intemperate courſe of living: It is as if we ſhould deſire that the effect may ceaſe, while the cauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in act; that God would not be angry, though we continually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him, and that he would not hate us, though we do not love him. Let a man raiſe his confidence by what arts he pleaſeth, and ſpeak with a boldneſs in his prayers, as though he would command heaven, and have what he would of God; yet he cannot have a true faith that he ſhall be heard, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he utterly abandon in heart and reſolution, whatſoever is incompatible and cannot ſtand with the things that he deſires. We may call our Faſts by the name of <hi>dayes of prayer</hi> (as we commonly do) but though we ſhould pray from morning until night, though the whole Nation ſhould cry to God that he would bow the heavens and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170332:39"/>come to ſave us, though it ſhould be with a voice that would rend the clouds, and ſeem to make way for him to come down to our reſcue; yet if we be in love with our ſins, the cauſes of our trouble, we have put in ſuch a ſtrong Caveat, ſuch a barr to our ſuits and petitions in the Court of heaven, that we can obtain no audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And therefore ſome Heathens were wiſer then theſe ſottiſh children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (as <hi>Jer.</hi> calls them, 4.22.) for when <hi>Niniveh</hi> was afraid of Gods Judgements, they not only proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Faſt, and cryed mightily to the Lord, but they turned every one from their evil way, and the violence that was in their hands, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.5, 8. It is a prudent ſaying of <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria; Faſting is a choice thing,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <hi>In</hi> Iſa. 58.3.</note> 
                  <hi>it is to humble our ſouls in Gods eyes; but it is moſt abſurd for thoſe that come in this manner to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mercy, to provoke the divine Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver in another way, by not loving to do his commands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. But ſo willing are men to deceive
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170332:40"/>themſelves, that though ſometimes they go a little further, yet they ſuffer their prayers to fall ſhort of heaven. When men have made their faces ſour with faſting, they begin ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to look angrily upon their ſins, and to take up ſome reſolutions to be revenged on them. And therefore they beg the divine grace to deſtroy them, and beſeech him to ſend his Spirit to purge their ſouls from them. But then as if they had no mind to be heard, they reſolve to be at no trouble nor pains themſelves about this great buſineſs. They leave all to the care of God, whom they would have ſo far to concern himſelf in our affairs, as not to expect that we ſhould be ſuch creatures as he made us. They ſit ſtill and wait for an unheard of power from above, as if divine Faith were a rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on God to carry ſuch by force to heaven, who have no liſt to walk in the way thither. Such prayers have a perfect likeneſs to the requeſts of the man in the Fable to <hi>Hercules,</hi> when his cart ſtuck faſt in the mire, who would neither prick forward his
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170332:40"/>Oxen, nor lay his own ſhoulders to the wheels, nor unload the waggon, but caſt all upon the ſtrength of his God, expecting that he ſhould come and draw it out. And ſuch an anſwer as was returned to that ſilly ſwain, will very well befit ſuch petitioners:

They are in all regards therefore <hi>idle prayers</hi> which careleſs ſinners put up for divine aid and ſtrength, ſeeing they cannot ſpeak common ſenſe, nor know the meaning of their own language. They ask <hi>ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour</hi> againſt their enemies, but either
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170332:41"/>they mean nothing, or elſe victory without fighting: and if that be it they mean, it is as if they asked no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, becauſe there is no ſuch thing to be granted. O that all men would at laſt learn to <hi>labour</hi> for that after which they ſeem to long; and not make a <hi>perpetual trade of praying much, and doing little or nothing.</hi> Let us not meerly run from one Church to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from private Faſts to publick, from common to extraordinary devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for this was the manner of the heathen people, who when they could not prevail by their daily ſacrifices and prayers, betook themſelves to more laborious but unſucceſsful devices. We read of <hi>Moab</hi> in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 16.12. <hi>that when he was weary in the high places, he came to his ſanctuary to pray, but he could not prevail; i. e.</hi> when they had tired themſelves with petitions for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, after the ordinary form that was uſed, they went to the moſt holy place in the Land, where their great god <hi>Chemoſh</hi> was worſhipped, and there they doubted not but to ſpeed. But as they prevailed not, becauſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170332:41"/>they did nothing at all but pray; no more ſhall we (of whom they are a perfect picture) while we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in our repeated prayers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a real reformation. This kind of faith which men cheriſh in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, is the moſt horrid infidelity, greater then which, the worſhippers of <hi>Chemoſh</hi> or <hi>Baal</hi> could not be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of. For they believe not him at all who hath ſaid, <hi>Unleſs ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh,</hi> Luke 13.3. And <hi>whatſoever we ask, we receive of him, becauſe we keep his commandements, and do the things that are pleaſing in his ſight,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.22.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But I muſt add further, that the caſe may ſo be, that though there be ſome Good men in a Nation that do moſt ſeriouſly and heartily pray for it, yet they may not be able to help it, nor prevail for the averting of Gods anger. For the atteſting of which truth, I might call in the Teſtimony of the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> cap. 11. where after God had ſaid, ver. 11. that if the people did cry unto him, he would not hearken unto them, he adds,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170332:42"/>ver. 14. that he will not have the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet pray for them, nor lift up a cry in their behalf, for it ſhall be in vain. The like to which you may read, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.11. And therefore he ſaith in <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.8, 44. <hi>that when he did cry and ſhout, God ſhut out his prayers, and covered himſelf with a cloud, ſo that they could not paſs through.</hi> The like teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony <hi>Ezekiel</hi> would afford us, who tels us more then once, <hi>cap.</hi> 14. that in ſome caſes, three ſuch prevalent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as <hi>Noah, Job</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain no more then their own ſecurity. And I might have all their ſuffrages to this, that ſometimes nothing leſs then an univerſal reformation (in the great Officers, Magiſtrates and Governors eſpecially) will procure Gods favour. But it is time to draw towards a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this Chapter; and in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing diſcourſes this matter will be abundantly cleared.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Then our prayers are to good purpoſe for our ſelves or the Nation, when we or they come to God with an holy diſpoſition of heart to forſake our ſins which we pray may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170332:42"/>with a readineſs of heart to make uſe of that divine grace which we beg at his hands; and with a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to do that our ſelves, which we deſire he would do for us. When they are inſtruments to Piety and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and put our hearts into ſuch an holy frame, that even by our actions we may pray and pull down the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of heaven upon us, then they are indeed ſtrong and prevailing peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For as <hi>Clemens Alex.</hi> ſpeaks of a ſpiritual perſon, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>His whole life is a prayer to God, and a familiar converſe with him.</hi> He prayes all day long in ſome ſort, <hi>viz.</hi> as to the effect and iſſue of prayer. For the holineſs of his life ſpeaks moſt powerfully and effectually, if not more prevalently then any other thing in his behalf to God, being the uſe and the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that grace which he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and ſo directly intitleing him to the bleſſings that are in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>To him that hath ſhall be given.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. But yet we muſt take notice of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170332:43"/>this, <hi>that when we pray thus to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming and amending of our hearts and lives, the bleſsings that we are moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently to expect, are thoſe of a ſpiritual and eternal nature:</hi> Such as are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins, acceptance with God to life; and we cannot be certain ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that by all our reformation we ſhall avert temporal judgements upon our own perſons, or our Nation. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Decree may be irrevocably gone forth, the ruine of a people or perſon may be abſolutely determined, or at leaſt ſome very ſharp puniſhment, without any poſſibility of reverſing the ſentence, may be reſolved upon; and though the ſin may be forgiven to ſome (and thoſe the chiefeſt) pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, yet not to all. Who can tell whether God will return and repent? was all that could be ſaid in the Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites caſe. And in the caſe of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> it was at laſt decreed, that their City and Temple ſhould be deſtroyed without any hopes of prevention of ſuch a calamity, though they had ſpace given them to repent, in that their ſouls might find mercy. Though it
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170332:43"/>be ſaid of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> that he turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his ſoul, and with all his might, ſo that there was none like him; <hi>yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Lord turned not from the fierceneſs of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled againſt</hi> Judah, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.25, 26. And afterward when they were carried captive, the Lord decreed a ſeventy years baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and though many, no queſtion, were reformed, and they poured out their prayer when Gods chaſtning was upon them, yet they could not get the time cut ſhort, nor ſpy any hopes of deliverance, as you may ſee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.16, 17, 18. <hi>Like as a woman</hi> (ſay they) <hi>with child, that draweth nigh to the time of delivery, is in pain, and cryeth out in her pangs: ſo have we been in thy ſight, O Lord. We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth, neither have the inhabitants of the world faln.</hi> This therefore is our ſatisfaction, that when we faſt and pray aright, we ſhall partake of the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170332:44"/>principal benefits that attend upon them, though not always of all the fruits and bleſſings which have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by been procured.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THoſe prayers that we ſpoke of in the laſt Chapter, were thought by the Iſraelites to be moſt powerful, which were offered up at the time of the morning and evening ſacrifice, which were the hours of prayer. And therefore in theſe <hi>ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſices</hi> they put a great deal of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which they were not forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170332:44"/>to offer unto God after as liberal a ſort as he could wiſh: They hoped by theſe holy vapors, together with their own holy breath, to make heaven of their mind, and ſtoop to their deſires. And therefore as on the day of the <hi>great Faſt</hi> there was the greateſt ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of expiation offered for the ſins of the people: So we may preſume that on other dayes of faſting they offered ſome extraordinary ſacrifices. And ſo much, me thinks, may be collected out of the Book of <hi>Judith,</hi> where we read, <hi>cap.</hi> 4. 14. that on their faſting dayes <hi>the high Prieſt</hi> and the reſt of the ſons of <hi>Aaron</hi> ſtood and miniſtred before the Lord, with their loyns girt with ſack-cloth, and offered the daily burnt offerings with the vows and free gifts of the people. In <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.12. we read alſo of burnt-offerings joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with faſting, and crying unto God. Theſe ſacred vapors, and the holy perfumes of incenſe, they thought would ſcatter all infections that might annoy the air. If they did but pay God his <hi>ſheaf</hi> and his <hi>cake,</hi> at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed times of firſt-fruits, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170332:45"/>him a plentiful Table every day; then they feared no famine to eat up their Land. The beaſts that were ſlain at their Altar, they thought would fright away all wild beaſts from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among them. While the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fire burnt, they could not imagine that any other fires ſhould conſume them. They hoped that <hi>Ariel</hi> (as the Altar is called, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.15.) <hi>i. e. the ſtrong one,</hi> or <hi>the Lyon of God,</hi> would devour all their enemies, as it did the fleſh that was laid upon it. God is ſaid to dwell between the ſhoulders of <hi>Benjamin</hi> (<hi>Deut.</hi> 33.12.) becauſe the Altar and the houſe of God ſtood in the portion of that tribe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome of the Jews interpret that bleſſing which <hi>Jacob</hi> gave him, to be meant of the morning and evening ſacrifices, when it is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.27. Benjamin <hi>ſhall raven as a Woolf in the morning, he ſhall devour the prey, and at night he ſhall divide the ſpoil.</hi> As though the Altar did but feed upon its own conqueſts, and feaſt it ſelf with its own victories over their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And indeed when God ſpeaks
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170332:45"/>concerning the deſtruction of the Aſſyrians who beſieged <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he deſcribes himſelf in this manner, <hi>The Lord whoſe fire is in</hi> Sion, <hi>and whoſe furnace is in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.9. As if the Angel ſhould come with fire from the Altar to burn up the Army of <hi>Senacherib,</hi> which was incamped about the City of God. And God dwelling thus among them in a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner made them much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume upon his favour towards them, hoping that he would maintain his own habitation, and not ſuffer himſelf to be ejected. They little thought that he would ever be a <hi>conſuming fire</hi> to them, or burn up his own houſe, but they imagined his wrath would ſmoak only againſt the heathen, and this fire on the Altar would only ſcorch their adverſaries if they did take care but to feed it with conſtant ſacrifices.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But in this they were miſerably miſtaken, and it proved to be quite otherwiſe then they accounted. For if you read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.1, 2. you ſhall find that God pronounces a wo to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170332:46"/>
                  <hi>Ariel</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) and ſaith, though they ſhould obſerve all their yearly feaſts, and kill a multitude of ſacrifices, yet he will diſtreſs his own City, <hi>and it ſhall be unto him as</hi> Ariel, <hi>i. e.</hi> the people ſhould be ſlaughtered juſt as the beaſts were at the Altar. It is like that they had given to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> this name of <hi>Ariel,</hi> becauſe of the Altar of God that was in it, wherein they truſted. They took this City to be as ſtrong as a mighty Lyon, and that none ſhould be able to prevail againſt the mountain of God (as the word <hi>Harel</hi> ſignifies, which is once uſed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.15.) But the Prophet tells them, that they ſhould reſemble <hi>Ariel</hi> in a quite contrary ſenſe; that name they ſhould call their City by, but much to their coſt. For as the blood of the ſacrifices was poured out, and their fleſh torn in pieces by <hi>Ariel,</hi> or the Altar; ſo he ſaith, ſhould their blood be ſhed, and their enemies ſhould rend them, as a Lyon doth his prey. And therefore he tels them by the Prophet <hi>Jerem.</hi> cap. 14. 12. that <hi>when they faſt, he will not hear their cry,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170332:46"/>and when they offer burnt-offerings and oblations; he will not accept them, but conſume them by the ſword, and by the famine, and by the peſtilence.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> tell them, <hi>that though they ſhould go with their flocks and with their herds to ſeek the Lord, they ſhould not find him, Hoſ.</hi> 5.6. though they ſhould bring a drove of ſacrifices to inforce their prayers, and ingratiate themſelves with him, yet they ſhould not gain his preſence, but he would be with-drawn from them. And in the next Chapter God tells them of a thing more delightful to him then any ſacrifices, and that was to do good to the poor, and become like to God whom they worſhipped, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.6. But of that they had very little; no more <hi>goodneſs</hi> then a morning cloud, ver. 4. They had not much more then the reek that went up from their ſacrifices in the morning, ſome little ſprinklings and drops of good nature, but no hearty and divine love unto others. And therefore <hi>I have hewen them</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by the Prophets, I have ſlain them by the word of my mouth,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170332:47"/>and thy judgements are as a light that goeth forth.</hi> Which laſt phraſe may be interpreted to this ſenſe, that their puniſhments ſhould be as manifeſt and viſible to all, as the flame that went from their ſacrifices was unto them; For thoſe was not the things that he ſo much deſired, but as it follows in the next verſe, <hi>He deſired mercy and not ſacrifice,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And that you may ſee how much he undervalued theſe things, it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable what is noted by <hi>Maimonides,</hi> that as there was no ſacrifices admitted for the greateſt ſins (as all conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men know) ſo the ſmalleſt ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were offered for greater ſins, and greater ſacrifices for the leſs. For Idolatry and apoſtacy from the one God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> there was no offering preſcribed, but the guilty perſon was to be ſtoned. But for idolatry igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly committed (concerning which crime they interpret that place, <hi>Lev.</hi> 4.27.) the offering was a kid of the goats, and that a female. No creature that was offered, was accounted more vile then a goat, and the female is of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170332:47"/>meaner condition then the male; and yet this was all that was to be offered (according to that underſtanding of thoſe words) for ſo great a ſin: Whereas a leper, who ſuffered only a bodily defilement, was to offer two hee-lambs, (which were more noble, both in kind and ſex) beſides one ewe-lamb for his cleanſing, <hi>Lev.</hi> 14.10. And ſo an offering for a <hi>treſpaſs,</hi> which was a ſmaller fault, was to be a ram, <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.6. but in an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for <hi>ſin,</hi> which was a greater, a goat would ſerve the turn (which was a lower creature) and a female, which was of the lower ſex, <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.6. By this might be ſignified, that as the ſacrifices could not expiate for ſin by their own worth and value (for then the greateſt muſt have been given for the greateſt fault) ſo the greater ſins they committed againſt him, of the leſs acceptableneſs were all their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and the more he did undervalue them. He could not be drawn to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of their evil doings, by all the pompous entertainments they made for him at his Table, which was the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170332:48"/>Altar; no, when their iniquities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, he did as good as ſay, Away with them, I care not for them, bring me not the fleſh of ramms, or of lambs, I had as leive eat of a ſhee-goat, unleſs you will be better. Inſomuch that if they grew enormous and hainous in their crimes, God would have nothing to do with them, nor accept any of their gifts that they would beſtow upon him; there being no ſacrifice appointed for the breach of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral precept. And therefore by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> he ſharply reproves their forwardneſs and diligence in theſe ſervices, ſaying, <hi>To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is the multitude of your ſacrifices? I am full of burnt-offerings,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>i. e.</hi> I even nauſeate the plenty of theſe devotions) <hi>When you come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hands?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Sabbaths, the calling of Aſſemblies I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the ſolemn meeting; your new moons,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are a trouble to me, I am weary to bear them,</hi> &amp;c. And he bids them, if they intend that he ſhould ſpeak kindly to them, and be friends
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170332:48"/>with them, that they ſhould <hi>ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well, and put away the evil of their doings from before his eyes, Iſa.</hi> 1.11, 12, 13, &amp;c. Strange indeed it was, and worſe then all the reſt, that they ſhould ſee ſo much reaſon to do all thoſe things, and yet ſee no reaſon to be good. But they were like to moſt men now, who will have God to be pleaſed with what pleaſes them, and gives no great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte to their natures; but will part with nothing that they dearly love, though it be the greateſt offence to him. Very deſirous they were to give God content by ſacrifices, and make him ſatisfaction, even for the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſins, if we may believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For the burnt-offerings, as ſome of them ſay, was to expiate for the thoughts of the heart, or (in their phraſe) for that which goes up in the heart; but they forgot what <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith in another place, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. that unleſs the unrighteous man forſake his <hi>thoughts,</hi> and return to the Lord, he will not have mercy on him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And the Chriſtian world ſtill
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170332:49"/>depends on their <hi>prayers,</hi> which are their daily ſacrifices; and on their <hi>Alms,</hi> which are another offering unto God; and upon their <hi>Altar</hi> (as the Lords Table may be called) where they repreſent Chriſts ſacrifice of himſelf: I heartily wiſh there were more of all theſe acts of Religion exerciſed; but if Prayer do but hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our unjuſt and unrighteous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and if Alms be but a bribe for the paſſing by of our drunkenneſs and debauchery; and if the Table of the Lord be but the putting of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement upon him, after we have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes offended him, and continue ſtill to ſin againſt him: we ſhall but ſtill maintain and propagate to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that falſe and hypocritical ſpirit, againſt which, God hath of old ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſo much hatred.

AND now I might ſhew, that as God expects a through reformation in all things (which I have already often ſuggeſted, and ſhall more fully ere long demonſtrate) ſo we muſt continue in that ſtate, and not put away our ſins only for a ſhort time, till we think that Gods anger is paſſed over us, and will not fall down upon us. To be good for a while, after we have faſted, confeſſed our ſins, and prayed, will not quite turn away his wrath, though it may deferr it. That which God expects, is an eternal divorce between us and our ſins, and that we ſeek him with our whole heart, ſo as to continue in well
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170332:50"/>doing. For elſe with our return again to folly, the ſtripes which are for the back of fools will return alſo. And commonly the caſe is more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the diſeaſe harder to cure when we do relapſe, after we were pretty well recovered; and the rods which before were prepared for us, will be turned into ſcorpions. But the holy Story is ſo clear in this, that he muſt be much unacquainted with the condition of this people in all thoſe times, that doth not ſee it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore knowing every one can furniſh himſelf with proofs enough, if he do but read any one Book of their Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, I ſhall herein ſpare my further labour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I might take occaſion likewiſe here to ſhow, that though all this be done out of conſcience, and we would not for any good omit theſe perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, but out of a kind of honeſty we obſerve dayes of faſting, times of confeſſion, and conſtant prayer, and have pious intentions in the buſineſs, yet this will not procure our good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance. But it is plain enough in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170332:50"/>the temper of this people, as I noted in the beginning of this diſcourſe. You could not have hired them to have laid down theſe Faſts; and when they could not offer ſacrifices at the Temple, they were very conſtant in their prayers at thoſe times that they uſed to be offered; And becauſe they could not in their captivity offer thoſe ſacrifices that are commanded to be <hi>added</hi> on the eight dayes of the Feaſt of Tabernacles to the conſtant ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, <hi>Numb.</hi> 29. they uſed certain pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar prayers (which they retain to this day) which they recited at that time that thoſe ſacrifices uſed to be offered at the Temple, calling the time wherein they recited them <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaph,</hi>

                  <hi>i. e.</hi> an <hi>additament</hi> to their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary devotions. And they were very ſcrupulous in their conſciences alſo (a thing that many pleaſe themſelves in very much, as a mark of piety) and they came to the Prophet, as men do now to the Miniſter, for to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. Very loth they were to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe God, by the neglect of ſuch good duties, and if it were his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170332:51"/>they would ſtill perform them; but alas! poor ſouls, this was the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie the Scripture ſo much ſpeaks of, the finer ſort of hypocriſie, that carries ſo many to Hell in a pleaſing belief that they are going to Heaven. They were ſerious and zealous in ſome things, but not in all; and ſo they did but in good earneſt (as we ſay) and in a more ſober way ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to cheat their ſouls. They faſted very ſeverely, they mourned very bitterly, knocked their breaſts heartily, confeſſed devoutly, and prayed earneſtly, and ſacrificed plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; but yet they did not <hi>ſearch and try their wayes, to turn again unto the Lord;</hi> they did not every one <hi>put away the evil of their doings;</hi> and ſo all their zeal in the former things, inſtead of doing them good, wrought their greater miſchief, by making them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently to account themſelves Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious perſons, and to be angry with the Prophets, who would perſwade them to the contrary.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It were well now, if every one (before he read any further) would
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170332:51"/>examine his own heart, and give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an account whether he have done thus much, as the peple of the Jews did, and then whether he have done any more. There are not many, it is like, that have thus faſted, and wept, and prayed, either for their own good, or the good of their Nation; and at what a vaſt diſtance are they from Gods favour, who are not come to the porch of his houſe, no are not in the way to become his ſervants? But I doubt they are very hard to be found (one perhaps of a thouſand) that make a conſcience not to ſin, and to keep a Faſt every day to God, by the conſtant practice of mortification, and holy living. If railing and ſwearing againſt their enemies, if damning and curſing thoſe that are the cauſe of our troubles, were the things that would cure our Nation, we need not light a candle to find a multitude of ſuch Saviours, their deeds of darkneſs being ſo open and manifeſt: And if praying, faſting, and ſuch like things, had been plaiſters broad enough for our wounds, they had been long ſince
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170332:52"/>cloſed by many pretenders: But as for thoſe who pray for their enemies, and live all their prayers, and exerciſe daily denyal of themſelves, though they are not ſo few, but we can ſee their light ſhining before men, yet they are ſcarce enough to teſtifie to all men that their deeds are evil, nor have they been able hitherto, to daſh the out-ſide Religion out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and to prevail for ſalvation to be brought to us. I leave it to the private ſcrutiny of every mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to find whether or no he be in the number of thoſe that are heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their wounds ſlightly, or of thoſe that thoroughly amend their wayes and doings. And I have ſaid enough to let him know the ſtate of his ſoul, if he will impartially ranſack his heart, and have no mind to put a cheat upon himſelf. If it be neceſſary further to aſſiſt him, the explication of the ſecond thing which I propoſed to be conſidered, will I hope, contribute ſome further help to his ſincere ſearch, both into his own, and the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions condition, unto which I ſhall now betake my ſelf.</p>

THE Prophets of God were not like the Fanatique ſpirits which are now in the world, that know how to find fault with what is in uſe, but cannot adviſe how to amend it; nor like Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Phyſitians, that cry out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all vulgar and old-wives medicines,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170332:53"/>but know not themſelves how to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply any that are more proper for the diſeaſe: But when they caſt ſo much diſreſpect upon their Faſts and other Religious duties, they directed to the true uſe of them; and when they ſhowed how the falſe Prophets that were among them, did but flatter and humour their diſtemper, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered its true nature, and preſcribed them a certain and effectual way of cure. And it was no far-fetcht medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine to which they adviſed them; there was no need that they ſhould climb up to heaven, and conſult with the Planets, or go beyond the Sea and traffique with ſome ſtrange Countrey for it, as we do for drugs to cure our bodily diſeaſes; but the Word was nigh them, even in their mouthes, and in their hearts, that they might do it. <hi>A general reformation of their manners,</hi> was that to which they exhorted (if the people expected a General good) as he that doth not want eyes, may read in every leaf of their Books. All the exerciſes of devotion which they uſed, were but in order to this: And
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170332:53"/>without this, all their <hi>Faſts</hi> were but painful provocations; all their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsions</hi> but accuſations brought in againſt themſelves; all their <hi>Prayers</hi> but the labour of their lungs, which like bellows, did make the fire of Gods anger burn, and not blow it out.

               <p n="2">2.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170332:54"/>of another Faſt which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed (ver. 9.) he took the ſame courſe, and cauſed <hi>Baruch</hi> to read his exhortations and threatnings in the ears of all the people of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and thoſe that came likewiſe out of the Cities of <hi>Judah</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Hereby teaching them, that their faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and praying was to no purpoſe, unleſs they hearkened to Gods voice, <hi>by returning every man from his evil way,</hi> which he ſaith was the only way to obtain forgiveneſs of their ſins, ver. 3. and 7.

But one true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I ſuppoſe, that there was not a general reformation in all things made by theſe Judicatures, was becauſe they heard only matters of fact againſt ſuch Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to which there
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170332:55"/>was a puniſhment annexed. Now there was a great penalty inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all thoſe that did eat upon the great Faſt a bit of bread, though but as big as a date, and on other Faſts the quantity of an Olive; but for covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, unmercifulneſs, and ſuch like things, you read of no puniſhment at all. If a man did not faſt, he was to be cut off by excommunication, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.29. and beſides by the decrees of the Elders, he was to be beaten: And for the breach of any of the <hi>nine firſt Commandments,</hi> you ſhall find ſome, either death, or ſome great puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment threatned: But for the breach of the Tenth Commandment, which is, <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet,</hi> there is no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral penalty which they incurred, for we find none threatned. And therefore they were more carefull to keep the Sabbath, not to worſhip idols, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (though in theſe ſometimes they were negligent) then to do juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and love mercy: Becauſe they might ſuffer for the one by the hand of the Magiſtrate, but not for the other.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170332:56"/>in any awe of any bodily inflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they took occaſion, as the Apoſtle ſaith (<hi>Rom.</hi> 7.8) to be more licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and to work all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And the ſins indeed againſt this Commandment, and thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our neighbours, were thoſe which the Prophets called chiefly for refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in, if they expected any good to their Land. This I will firſt of all ſhew you out of the ſame Prophet <hi>Zachary,</hi> upon whoſe words I built the former diſcourſe. After he had told them from the Lord, that they had not faſted to him in all the ſeventy years of their affliction, he proceeds to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them what the <hi>true Faſt</hi> was, which God alwayes called for and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. And that he doth, chap. 7. 9, 10. and again, chap. 8. 16, 17. which places I deſire the Reader to take pains to conſider. And then I doubt not but he will ſee good cauſe for this obſervation, that the ſins they were chiefly guilty of more then others, were, <hi>Neglects of the duties of the ſecond Table</hi> (as we ſpeak) <hi>not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170332:56"/>of thoſe offices which one man owes to another; but violent breaking of all thoſe bonds whereby men are tyed by God together.</hi> They may be reduced to theſe three heads.</p>

               <p n="5">5. Concerning all which ſins, you muſt note theſe things. That all of the Nation were generally guilty of the breach of the tenth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170332:57"/>there being nothing to reſtrain them from it, but only the fear and love of God, and the belief of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life, of which that ſtiff-necked generation had very little ſenſe. And this covetouſneſs or greedineſs of the things of this world (which God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving liberally promiſed them, they were the more deſirous of) was the root of all that evil which broke out againſt the other commands of the ſecond Table. And their <hi>Rulers</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially were guilty of this, and the reſt of the ſins that proceeded from it, both becauſe they had fairer occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſatisfie thoſe deſires, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though many of their ſins againſt the Law were puniſhable, yet the puniſhment could be executed upon them who were in the ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, by none but God. And theſe ſins were the greater in <hi>them,</hi> becauſe they ought to have rectified others, and given them a better precedent to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; and the greater in the people likewiſe, both becauſe they might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily have learnt better, and becauſe they were the ſins for which their
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170332:57"/>fore-fathers had been puniſhed very ſeverely by God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is an obſervation of <hi>Philo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De animal. ſacr. idon.</note> in the book fore-mentioned, that among all thoſe living creatures that were offered in ſacrifice, whether aerial or terreſtrial, there were none choſen by God, but thoſe that were of a gentle and good nature. The Dove, of all thoſe that love ſociety and company, is moſt mild; and the Turtle, of all thoſe that are naturally ſolitary, is moſt eaſie to be made tame and brought to hand. And among the flocks of four-footed creatures, thoſe three ſorts that were ſelected for holy uſe <hi>(the oxen, the ſheep, the goats)</hi> are of all other the moſt gentle and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive; one man, or a boy, being ſufficient to drive whole herds of them to paſture, and again to bring them back without any rebellion, to their ſtalls and folds. And this (ſaith he) alſo is a moſt manifeſt token of their gentleneſs, that none of them eat fleſh, but all of them graſs and herbs, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they armed with ſuch hooked claws and tallons, nor with ſuch rows
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170332:58"/>of teeth as other creatures. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides they are the moſt profitable and uſeful, as well as moſt innocent and harmleſs of all others. For the <hi>ſheep</hi> afford clothes for our bodies; the <hi>oxen</hi> plow the earth, and after it hath yielded its fruit, they tread out the corn; and the hair and skins of goats make clothes for travellers, and ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and ſuch like perſons, whoſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities force them to abide much in the open air. From all which (me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks) we may gather, that they were taught by thoſe things wherein they did moſt confide, not only to keep good order by Juſtice and Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, not uſing any rapacity or crooked dealing: but alſo to be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted, loving, gentle, living in all peaceableneſs together, and being beneficial and uſeful unto others. God many times ſaid it, that it was not the fleſh or blood of beaſts, wherein he delighted; and therefore hence they might eaſily have received documents that he <hi>deſired mercy more then ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> and that they would preſent him with the qualities of thoſe creatures,

               <p n="7">7. But as the proverb tels us, that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. <hi>A bad bird hath a bad egg;</hi> So it was with this people. Theſe ſins being the faults of their fore-fathers, they were the more eaſily inclined to take after them. And though they might have learnt by their anceſtors harms, who were ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhed for them: yet either by the ſweetneſs of theſe ſins, that made them forget the puniſhement, or by the conceit of the purity of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, wherein they excelled their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; they trod in the ſame ſteps with them, and became guilty of the very ſame faults which had been ſo fatally miſchievous unto others. For in the ſecond part of this ſeventh of <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> God tells them what words he had ſpoken to their progenitors by the Prophets of old; who for theſe ſins, together with two other (Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking and Idolatry) were turned out of the promiſed Land. Other ſins indeed there are mentioned by the Prophets, but none ſo much inſiſted on as theſe, to be the cauſe of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170332:59"/>out of Gods Land, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment into a ſtrange Countrey; as you ſhall diſcern before I have gone much further. Now it ſeems that their poſterity (the men of the captivity) were grown more obſervant of the Sabbath, and greater haters of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and becauſe of their Religious ſervices which were more pure, took themſelves for very good men, though they retained their fathers injuſtice and fraud, cruelty and unmercifulneſs, oppreſſion and violent dealing. Which was plainly the caſe of the Phariſees alſo (the poſterity of thoſe perſons) in our Saviours time, before this their laſt and long diſperſion. They were notoriouſly guilty of theſe ſins, more then any other, whileſt they could not be challenged with any idolatrous practiſes, or with neglect of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day, no nor with leſs ſtrictneſs in any other Religious performances. Under their Religion, they cloaked their unrighteouſneſs, and made all their piety good for nothing, being ſtained with covetouſneſs, oppreſſion of the widdows, and violence toward
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170332:59"/>thoſe that had no helpers, with ſuch like wickedneſs.</p>
               <p n="8">8. From all which we may be bold to affirm ſtill, that God proceeds in ſuch a method of Juſtice with Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that where he finds theſe ſins to remain, it is in vain to faſt, and pray, and cry to God for mercy, yea to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in other matters which concern Gods worſhip and ſervice. And yet the moſt noiſe is commonly made about theſe, out of hope their prayers, and preachings, and other Religious offices, together with the aſſerting of theſe from ſuperſtition and impure mixtures, will drown the cry of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, cruelty, blood, oppreſſion and ſuch like ſins, which are deſtructive of all humane ſociety. But far be it from the Lord and Governor of the world, to ſuffer himſelf to be fawned upon by ſuch perſons, who while they cry out againſt ſuperſtition, are the moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious. For out of a great fear and dread of God, they crouch unto, and ſpeak him fair, and lay great ſtreſs upon ſome ſmall things wherein he hath given greater liberty; and they
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170332:60"/>hope, that becauſe of all this he will wink and connive at their evil doings to their neighbours, of whom they ſtand in no awe at all. But as I ſaid, he that loves good order, <hi>and rules the Nations in righteouſneſs and truth,</hi> will puniſh for theſe things as ſeverely as for the other, and without reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in them, he will hold no Nation guiltleſs, nor let them long live in peace. Of the which, that we may be the more ſenſible, I ſhall digeſt what remains concerning the ſtate of this people, in theſe particular conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Firſt, I ſhall make it appear that this of old was the Faſt which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of their Fathers by the Prophets,</hi> viz. <hi>That they ſhould forſake thoſe ſins that I have mentioned:</hi> And that he everywhere urges, even in the moſt reforming times before the captivity, their growing more juſt, and merciful in their dealings, and their practiſing thoſe duties which ariſe from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that one man hath to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Then I will manifeſt, that after

Let us next hear what informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> will give us concerning this matter, who lived in the ſame time with <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and ſpeaks ſtill more plainly (if it be poſſible ſo to do) againſt theſe ſins, as very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant in them and their Rulers. The Woe in the 2. chap. v. 1, 2. (which I beſeech you read) is againſt thoſe, who becauſe they had power in their hands, contrived how to greaten them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, though with the ruine of others. If they ſaw but a fair field or houſe which they coveted, it was made a prey to their luſt, and they took it away by violence, though it was the mans inheritance, and tended to his utter undoing. And though to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him they undid his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and together with their bodies, brought their ſouls to ruine, yet they ſacrificed them all to their covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and caſt both women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren out of their houſes, making them
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170332:65"/>thereby become Idolaters. Which may be the meaning of that phraſe, ver. 9. <hi>From their children have they taken away my glory for ever; i. e.</hi> by their cruelty they have made them flie to ſtrange Countries, and to loſe their Religion; or they have been the cauſe of their captivity, and carrying into a Land where God was not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped. Yea ſo ravenous and greedy were they, that they were not aſhamed to ſtrip thoſe ſtark naked, and leave them neither upper nor inner gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who were harmleſs and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, neither intending wrong to others, nor fearing any from them, as you may read, ver. 8. And in the 3. chap. 1, 2, 3. he ſpeaks of moſt barbarous and butcherly actions, the flaying and peiling of the people to the very bones. And as if that did not make them miſerable enough, they would have no pitty on thoſe poor Skeletons, but broke their very bones, and chopt them in pieces, as one doth when he puts fleſh in a pot; which is as much as to ſay, they utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devoured them, and eat them up.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170332:65"/>They did abhorr Judgement, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert <hi>all</hi> Equity (ver. 9.) and (which is to be obſerved) at that very time <hi>they built up</hi> Zion <hi>and</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>with this blood and iniquity,</hi> ver. 10. <hi>i. e.</hi> They repaired or enlarged the great City; they adorned the Kings pallace which was on mount <hi>Zian,</hi> and in all likelyhood they <hi>beautified the Temple,</hi> (for that is mentioned together with theſe two, ver. 12.) with this robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and murder that they committed. They were reformers of things amiſs, or decayed in Gods worſhip, at the coſt and charges of many a poor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, that they had rent in pieces, and ſhared amongſt them. For that theſe words were ſpoken in the times of reformation, you may learn from <hi>Jer.</hi> 26.18. where we are told that <hi>Micah</hi> made this threatning which is mentioned, ver. 12. <hi>of making</hi> Zion <hi>like a plowed field,</hi> &amp;c. in the dayes of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who you know repented of the evil his Fathers had done, and ſo turned away the evil in his time. Now what is all this which <hi>Micah</hi> ſaith, but what the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> hath already
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170332:66"/>told us. chap. 1. ver. 10, 21, 23. and again, chap. 3. ver. 13, 14, 15. where God reproves the <hi>Elders</hi> &amp; great ones <hi>for beating his people to pieces, and grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the faces of the poor,</hi> whoſe cauſe he ſaith he was come to plead: The Rulers then being ſo bad, there is little reaſon to expect much juſtice or mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy among the people, who alſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and offered violence one to another, as far as their power would reach. For proof of, which, ſpare not to read <hi>Mich.</hi> 6. ver. 10, 11, 12. and likewiſe the ſix firſt verſes of the ſeventh Chapter, which tells us large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>General cruelty, covetouſneſs, treachery,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>both of the Princes, and all the people, though never ſo nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated one to another.</hi> Which was ſo great and univerſal, that it was as hard to find a merciful and a juſt man, as to find a bunch of grapes, <hi>after the glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Vintage.</hi> And therefore in the ſixth Chapter, ver. 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God by the ſame Prophet <hi>calls not for their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and religious ſervices</hi> (in which it ſeems they were frank enough, and could have been contented to have put
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170332:66"/>themſelves to any expence, ſo they might but quietly have kept their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, griping and devouring luſts and deſires) <hi>but to do juſtly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. And in the dayes of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> things ſtill grew worſe, and proceeded to a greater height of injuſtice and cruelty. For as he is noted for a moſt groſs Idolater, ſo likewiſe for a great ſhedder of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood, wherewith he filled <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> 2 King. 21.16.24.3. ſuch violence, iniquity, grievances, pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of judgement there was in his dayes, that the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> (who ſome think was one of thoſe that God ſent to admoniſh him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 21.10.) could not endure to behold it, and ſeems to be wearied with crying to God againſt it, as you may ſee, if you read <hi>Habak.</hi> 1.2, 3, 4. Whereupon God threatens to raiſe up (with ſuch ſpeed, that no body would believe it) the Chaldean Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to deſtroy them, ver. 5. And this he did not long after the time of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> when the Chaldeans brought
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170332:67"/>the Aſſyrian power under their feet, of which only the Jews ſtood in fear.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If we draw nearer to the time of the firſt captivity into <hi>Babylon,</hi> by the hands of thoſe Chaldeans, which they little dreamed of; we ſhall hear no new Sermons, but the very ſame ſins ſtill reproved. <hi>Zephaniah</hi> will be our informer in this matter, who lived in the dayes of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> a good Prince, and very zealous to reform things amiſs in the worſhip of God. With him it is manifeſt (from 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.8.) the Nobles of the Realm joyned to purge the Land from Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, though we may gueſs from <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. v. 4, 5, 6. that many of the people did not affect their proceedings. And yet if you do but read the five firſt verſes of the third Chapter, you will eafily diſcern, how ſhameleſs theſe very Reformers were in their unjuſt and violent dealing, and that they would rather part with any thing (even their Idols) then theſe rich and thriving ſins. And therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet exhorts thoſe that had any of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170332:67"/>thoſe <hi>rare vertues</hi> in them, any merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and righteouſneſs, that they would go on to practice them, and in thoſe wayes to ſeek the Lord, telling them that it was probable (but not certain) that they might be ſecured in that deluge of miſery, that was like to overflow the whole Land, chap. 2. ver. 3. And afterwards, chap. 3.12, 13. he propheſies that <hi>the poor and the afflicted</hi> (they that had been oppreſſed and ſtript naked by the great and the rich) were the perſons that ſhould eſcape and be left in the Land, when all thoſe mens poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were taken from them, and that they ſhould be ſuch a remnant <hi>as ſhould not do iniquity,</hi> nor ſpeak lyes, nor have a deceitful tongue in their mouth, but ſhould truſt in God, and not in theſe evil arts.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> alſo, who propheſied in the dayes of the ſame <hi>Joſiah,</hi> and likewiſe of <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> and <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> in the time of both the firſt and ſecond captivity, and afterward alſo: He, I ſay, ſpeaks the very ſame words, as will be very evident to thoſe who will
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170332:68"/>do themſelves ſo much right, for the underſtanding of this truth, as to ponder theſe places of his propheſie. He tells us in the 3. chap. ver. 10. <hi>That</hi> Judah <hi>did not return to God with her whole heart, but fainedly;</hi> which words were ſpoken (as you may ſee ver. 6.) in the dayes of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> who had made <hi>a Covenant to ſerve the Lord with all their heart, and all their ſoul, and all the people ſtood unto it,</hi> 2 King. 23.3. This is the returning which the Prophet ſaith was but fained, becauſe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this great profeſſion, they were not ſincerely out of love with their ſins, nor did with all their heart, as they pretended, abhor them. For he tells us, chap. 7.9, 10. that many of them, though they came to the houſe of God to worſhip in the time of this reformation, yet had an Altar likewiſe in ſome private corner for <hi>Baal.</hi> And beſide this, they were all guilty of cheating, oppreſſion, ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, falſe-witneſſing, and all manner of injuſtice, as you may ſee there, ver. 4, 5, 6, 9. Inſomuch that he ſaith, ver. 11. the <hi>houſe of God was become a
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170332:68"/>den of Robbers, a meer neſt of thieves, where a crew of oppreſſors met together, thinking to expiate for all by their flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering devotions.</hi> And chap. 9. from the ſecond verſe to the ninth, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wails theſe ſins againſt our neighbours, and theſe alone with a ſad and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate heart, they being the very ſins that undid them, as he notes v. 6. <hi>(through deceit they refuſe to know me, ſaith the Lord)</hi> and as I ſhall ere long demonſtrate. For ſo General were theſe ſins, that there was not ſo much as a man that did juſtice to be found, though the ſalvation of the Nation had lain upon it, chap 5.1. And though God did ſmite them grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet they would not amend, ver. 3. but all hardened their faces as a rock in theſe evil courſes. The poor indeed one could not expect much from, and they might either be tempted by their needs to live by lyes, or they might be ignorant of the Law, and have leſs underſtanding what judgement was, ver. 4. but when he went to the great ones, who had better advantages of knowledge then the other, he found
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170332:69"/>that they were lawleſs alſo, and would be bound by no obligations of Law or conſcience to their duty, ver. 5. And therefore he ſaith of the City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> chap. 6.6. that <hi>ſhe was wholly oppreſsion,</hi> and ver. 7. that a continual ſtream of wickedneſs run down her ſtreets, ſo that he could ſee nothing but the ſad ſpectacles of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and wounded perſons.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> likewiſe will witneſs largely to this truth, who propheſied in the dayes of <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> in the time of the firſt captivity, chap. 1.1, 2. This perſon ſaw the glory of the Lord which dwelt between the Cherubims upon the Ark, departing from the holy place, and from the Nation by ſeveral ſteps and degrees. Firſt it went from off the Cherubims where it uſed to ſit, <hi>viz.</hi> from the mercy-ſeat, which was in the Weſt part of the Temple, and it <hi>ſtood over the threſhold of the houſe,</hi> chap. 10.4. Then it mounted upon the back of the Cherubims (which were that charriot deſcribed by him, chap. 1.) and they carried it to the Eaſt-gate of the houſe, at which
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170332:69"/>the people came to worſhip, ver. 18, 19, 20. But there being nothing but miſchief and violence to be found among thoſe that came to worſhip, though Princes of the people (chap. 11.1, 2, 6, 7.) they carry it into the midſt of the City, as you may gather from chap. 11. ver. 23. But the City being full of the blood of the ſlain, as you may ſee in thoſe verſes 6, 7. the Cherubims lift up their wings, and carry it away ſtill further off unto the mountain that was on the Eaſt-ſide of the City (ver. 22, 23.) which was the mount of <hi>Olives.</hi> And from thence it went quite away from his ſight, as he ſaith, ver. 24. which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies that God forſook the land becauſe of their iniquity.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Now that their iniquity for which he forſook it, was the ſame with that which I have mentioned, and that they were but little amended after the firſt captivity, you may ſee by that deſcriptio which he makes of thoſe perſons that God would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count righteous, and accept to life, and of thoſe who were ſo wicked, that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170332:70"/>they ſhould be deſtroyed. For this the moſt read the 18. chap. from the third verſe to the nineteenth, and chap. 33. ver. 14, 15, 16. where though he mention their idolatry, yet he enlarges far more upon theſe other ſins, and the contrary vertues. But eſpecially he notes the Rulers as moſt guilty in this kind, and therefore ſpends one whole Chapter in their reproof. For by Shepherds, chap. 34. you may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Governors of the people, and thoſe that bear office in the Land. So the Princes and Captains of <hi>Chaldaea</hi> that deſtroyed <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> are called <hi>Shepherds,</hi> (and their ſubjects their flocks, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.3.) and <hi>Paſtors,</hi> Jer. 12.10. Jer. 49.19, 20. Now theſe Shepherds of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> that ſhould have had a care of all the flock, they did not <hi>tondere,</hi> but <hi>deglubere,</hi> not ſhear them, but flea them, and pull their skins off from them: yea they tore their very fleſh, if they were fat and rich, ver. 3. And whereas they ſhould have been a guard to the people from Wolves and Devourers; if any poor weak man
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170332:70"/>of the flock was broken or wounded by the great beaſts, they never took care by right judgement to redreſs their grievances, but rather exerciſed more cruelty upon them, ver. 4. The richer ſort imitated them, and did vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to their poor neighbours, who could get no relief by the Law, which theſe Shepherds did not execute; and therefore God himſelf ſaith that he would come and <hi>judge between the fat cattle and the lean,</hi> ver. 18, 19, 20. Read alſo chap. 12.19. and chap. 22.6, 7, 9, 12. where God complains of the Princes and People both, and ſaith, ver. 13. that becauſe of this, <hi>he had ſmitten his hands at their diſhoneſt gain which they had made,</hi> &amp;c. Which was as if a man ſhould clap his hands at his enemies, and ſay, I will be revenged; you ſhall not eſcape ſo with your wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs. They thought that thoſe whom God had delivered into captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, were the ſinners that had provoked him, and therefore were caſt out, but that they who ſtill remained in the Land were his good people, and dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved of him. Whereas the Lord
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170332:71"/>ſaith, that he had ſent them out for their good, and would be a little San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary unto them, chap. 11.15, 16. which is exactly conformable to what <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaith, chap. 24. where he compares thoſe of the firſt captivity to <hi>good figgs,</hi> and they that remained to <hi>naughty figgs,</hi> that could not be eaten they were ſo bad; and ſaith that the former he had a reſpect unto, and would own them for his; but the latter he would make a reproach and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, a taunt and a curſe in all places whether they ſhould be driven.</p>
               <p>For their ſins muſt needs be the greater, in that they did not reform after ſuch a fair warning given them by the captivity of a part of their Nation, not above twelve year before; No nor when the Chaldeans were juſt ready to take their City again, and deſtroy them utterly, as you may note from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.21.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Theſe things they were ſo ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and rooted in, that they made but a mock of thoſe that came to reprove them, and threaten Gods judgements upon them. They did but laugh when
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170332:71"/>the Prophets told them that theſe ſins would deſtroy them, and that the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> would come like a ſeething pot to ſcald them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.13. We muſt be the fleſh, and this City is the Cauldron, ſay they, by way of flout (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.3.) when they were building houſes; and therefore we had beſt build in this place that is not near the City where we are to be ſod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. And therefore the Prophet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes this ſaying to another purpoſe, and tells them, that ſince they had multiplyed their ſlain in that City, and filled the ſtreets with them, (ver. 6.) he was ſure that thoſe mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered perſons might well be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to fleſh, and their City to the Cauldron where it had ſoaked and been ſodden in its own blood (ver. 7.) and that their ſaying did better ſet forth their own wickedneſs, then their puniſhment, which they would not believe ſhould come. For becauſe of their bloodineſs, he tells them they ſhould be ſlain, not in the City (where then they hoped for ſecurity) but in the border of the Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:170332:72"/>whether they fled, hoping that way to ſave themſelves when the City was taken, ver. 10, 11. But God had ſaid by <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> not only that he would ſend <hi>Fiſhers</hi> to fiſh them, and take them in a net (which was done in the ſiege of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) but hunters alſo, that ſhould purſue them, and ferret them out of every hole, as they did <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dekiah</hi> and his men of War, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 16.16.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And ſo indeed <hi>Jeremiah</hi> tells us they jeared at him, uſing to ſay to him when they met him in the ſtreet, <hi>What is the burden of the Lord? Jer.</hi> 23.33. As much as to fay, how now Prophet, what evil do you threaten us with all? What is the next miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief that we muſt expect? The word <hi>Burden</hi> in the Prophetical lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, ſignifies ſome great miſery and calamity that ſhould oppreſs them, and under which they were like to ſink, unleſs they repented; and many of them begin their Propheſies of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction with that word, as every one that reads them very well knows. Now the people often hearing this
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170332:72"/>word from his mouth, uſed to ſay in a mocking manner when they met him, What is the burden or puniſhment that you threaten us withall? And they did this in ſuch a contemptuous manner, that God threatens, ver. 36. <hi>That every mans word ſhould be his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, i. e.</hi> that every one ſhould be puniſhed who uſed this language. One reaſon of which ſtrong impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence might be, that they had gotten ſo much riches by this covetouſneſs and injuſtice, that they thought they could hire the Ethiopians to come and help them in a time of need, when ſome <hi>burden</hi> was like to fall upon them; See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.1, 2, 3. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5, 6. From the latter of which propheſies we may gather, that they pretended not to truſt in man and the arm of fleſh, ver. 9. but God ſaith in the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. ver. that he knew their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful heart well enough; and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens ver. 11. that all thoſe who had gotten their goods unjuſtly, ſhould be robbed of them by the hands of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> as a bird is of her eggs, which ſhe never hatcheth. And this
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170332:73"/>covetouſneſs I conceive might be the reaſon that they obſerved the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath no better, ver. 20, 21. and counted it a burden to them, when they did obſerve it, and carry no bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den through their gates, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.5, 6. Which made God deliver up all their treaſures (as I ſaid) wherein they confided, and <hi>to ſearch</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>with candles,</hi> ſo that they ſhould not be able to ſave a ſingle penny in any ſecret hole, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.12, 13. The King of <hi>Babylon</hi> robbed them, as the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> glorieth that he had done all Nations, of their goods; <hi>and his hand found as a neſt the riches of this people,</hi> Iſa. 10.13, 14.</p>
               <p n="12">12. I ſhould be too tedious, ſhould I write all that may be ſaid in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. The ten Tribes were guilty of the very ſame ſins, and this was the voice of the Prophets <hi>to them,</hi> as well as to <hi>Judah,</hi> that they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves, not only in their ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous worſhip, but in theſe matters alſo. But for this, I will referr the Reader to the Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> whoſe Viſion was concerning <hi>Samaria</hi> and

                  <hi>Princes</hi> in <hi>Joſiah's</hi> time, giving at the Paſsover, an offering of two thouſand ſix hundred ſmall cattle, and three hundred Oxen; when notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe were the men <hi>who like Lyons and Wolves tare the people in pieces, and gnawed the very bones; after they had done with the fleſh, making them as bare and poor as ever they could,</hi> according as <hi>Zephaniah</hi> hath told us. I hold it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to lead you through all their ſtory for the proof of this, ſeeing I have ſo often reflected light upon it in my paſſage through the former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And therefore I ſhall entreate you rather attentively to conſider a ſecond obſervation of great moment, which is this; <hi>That herein conſiſted a main ground of their hypocriſie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of themſelves, which brought them to utter ruine.</hi> A man muſt wink very hard that doth not ſee the duties of Juſtice and mercifulneſs, of pitty and favourable dealing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> written in <hi>capital letters,</hi> both upon his own heart, and in the book of God; and one would not think it poſſible that a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170332:75"/>man ſhould have ſuch ſtrange Arts of abuſing himſelf, as to make himſelf believe that he is a good man, and in a ſafe condition, while he lives in the violation of all theſe known principles. There muſt be ſome notable blind, ſome very plauſible trick, that can caſt ſuch a miſt before his eyes, and juggle him into ſuch a conceited belief, which here (I think) we have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. They had high thoughts of their divine worſhip, and looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Religious ſervices as hugely pleaſing unto God, and they knew themſelves to be very earneſt (it is like) in this piece of reformation; and ſo they judged themſelves to be the people of God, the right worſhip being reſtored, the Altar being cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Temple repaired by their means. Now their great zeal in theſe matters, and their forwardneſs to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the true Religion after ſo much Idolatry, made them over-look theſe little trifling things (as men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them) of juſtice and equity, of mercy and compaſſion, and to hope that God would do ſo alſo, and not be
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170332:76"/>angry with ſuch a reformed people for a ſmall matter. What I pray you (might they ſay in their hearts to a Prophet) will not God give leave to a people that hate idols, and obſerve diligently his Sabbaths, and offer him his conſtant ſacrifices in the right pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed manner, to get a little for themſelves in the world, and to uſe all Arts of growing rich, after they have been ſo faithful and liberal to him? Will he fall out with ſuch good friends of his upon ſo poor an occaſion? Cannot he be pleaſed that they give him his due, and defraud him of none of his right, though they be not ſo exact in their Juſtice one to another? Muſt he needs take notice what they do among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when they hope he hath no reaſon to complain that he is neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any piece of his own worſhip? Will it not ſatisfie him, that they are ſo zealous in thoſe great and weighty concernments of his, which had been ſo long diſregarded, and for which they had been ſo often threatned? Yes ſurely thought they, we are in a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170332:76"/>ſafe condition, God is well apayed, and we need not trouble our ſelves any further, but confidently wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, that he will be with us and ſave us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thus the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> tells us they found a way to deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as you may read, chap. 3.11. <hi>The heads thereof judge for reward, and the Prieſts thereof teach for hire, and the Prophets thereof divine for money; yet they will lean upon the Lord, and ſay, Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us.</hi> They would needs be Gods favourites, and thruſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon him, and be confident of his goodneſs to them, though they were conſcious to themſelves of all this wickedneſs. They cryed <hi>the Temple of the Lord,</hi> the <hi>Temple of the Lord,</hi> as long as thoſe of <hi>Epheſus</hi> cryed, <hi>Great is</hi> Diana <hi>of the Epheſians.</hi> And in this Temple-worſhip and Religion they truſted, thinking that God was fixed to that place, and that the Temple would ſecure them, as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the Trojans thought themſelves out of all danger, while they could
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170332:77"/>keep their <hi>Palladium.</hi> And therefore <hi>Jeremiah</hi> bids them not truſt in thoſe <hi>lying words,</hi> ſaying the Temple of the Lord are <hi>theſe; i. e.</hi> not hearken to the falſe Prophets, who told them that they were Gods Temple, a ſeparated people, an holy Nation, among whom God did dwell; for all this would not avail them, and they were <hi>words that would not profit,</hi> or give them any help, ver. 8. yet they dreamt, that as long as they kept their holy place pure, they need not fear the taking of their City: Juſt as the heathens thought their fortreſſes could never be won, while they could keep the good <hi>Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> of the place from being charmed away out of it. And ſo an excellent Linguiſt takes that word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Thele,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lud. de Dieu.</note> to refer not to the perſons, but to the ſeveral parts of the Temple, which agrees well with the words fore-going, ver. 2. where the Prophet is bid to ſtand in the gate of the Lords houſe, and to proclaim theſe words among the reſt, <hi>Truſt not in lying words, ſaying, The Temple of the Lord are theſe.</hi> As if he had pointed with
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170332:77"/>his finger to the buildings of the houſe of God, and ſaid to thoſe that came to worſhip, Do not deceive your ſelves in a vain confidence, that <hi>theſe</hi> will ſave you, as if God were bound to theſe dwellings. But yet they came and ſtood before God in his houſe (as he ſaith, ver. 10.) and ſaid, <hi>We are delivered,</hi> and that made them do all thoſe forementioned abominations. And therefore he gives them that reproof which you read, ver. 11. where he asks them, <hi>Is my heuſe become a den of Robbers in your eyes? behold I have ſeen it, ſaith the Lord; i. e.</hi> Do you imagine to fly to the Temple, as thieves to their den, and think all is ſafe, if you do but offer me ſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices? No, you are miſtaken; I ſee what you are well enough, and you cannot ſo deceive me. It is very plain that they were confident none of thoſe things ſhould come upon them, which the Prophets threatned; but gave God the lye through his meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ears, as you may read, <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.11, 12, 13. and therefore ſeeing they were ſo unjuſt, as he tells us there,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170332:78"/>ver. 1, 2. and ver. 25, 26, 27, 28. there muſt be ſomething whereby they ſtrengthened their hands in this wickedneſs. And he tells us, what it was in that chapter, ver. 14 when he calls the Temple <hi>the houſe wherein they truſted.</hi> They did ſwear by the name of God, and pretended great reverence to it; but it was not in truth and righteouſneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.1. they ſtiled themſelves by the name of the holy City, ver. 2. (viz. <hi>the men of</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, <hi>the people of</hi> Sion) and they ſtayed themſelves on the God of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> whereas they were ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted and far from righteouſnes, as you may read, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.12. But they offered to God ſacrifices out of their unlawful gains, and this they thought would bribe him to take no notice, as you may gather from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.8. <hi>The Lord loveth judgement, I hate robberie for burnt-offerings.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Vulgar Latine</hi> renders theſe words, <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.15. <hi>Numquid carnes (anctae auferent à te ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litias tuas in quibus gloriata es? Doſt thou think thy holy fleſh</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> thy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices) <hi>ſhall take away the wickedneſſes
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170332:78"/>wherein thou glorieſt?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Thou canſt not expiate for thy beloved ſins, by making God many oblations, as thou thinkeſt to do; no, never dream of it, for it is a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet knowing themſelves to be very zealous in their worſhip, they have the confidence to come and challenge God, as though they had wrong done them, and had hard mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at his hands, in not being ſaved by him from their enemies. <hi>Wherefore have we faſted, ſay they, and thou ſeeſt not? Wherefore have we afflicted our ſoul, and thou takeſt no knowledge?</hi> Iſa. 58.3. Do we not ſeek thee daily? do we not delight to know thy wayes, and take pleaſure in approaching to thee? do we not faſt and pray, and put our ſelves to a great deal of pains in thy ſervices? Why then doſt thou take no notice of us? how canſt thou deny ſuch importunate ſuitors to thee for thy favour? It ſeemed ſtrange to them, that he ſhould not love ſuch perſons, and condeſcend to their requeſts; and they thought
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170332:79"/>they might juſtly plead their cauſe with him, and that it would appear they were very innocent. But God there tels them (as you have ſeen) what was ſtill wanting; and their not obſerving of ſuch leſſons, made them run into ſuch a dangerous miſtake. And ſo the ſame Prophet ſpeaks in Gods name to them of the captivity, (by way of prediction) as though they were diſſatisfied about the Juſtice of Gods dealing with them. And he asks them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.1. <hi>Where is the bill of your mothers divorcement, whom I have put away? Or which of my creditors is it to whom I have ſold you? Behold, for your inquities have you ſold your ſelves, and for your tranſgreſsions is your mother put away; i. e.</hi> you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain as if I had without any great cauſe, or meerly for my pleaſure, put away your Nation which was married to me, as you uſe to do with your wives. You make as if I had ſold you, becauſe I was in want of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that you could not furniſh me withall,<note place="margin">Exod. 21.7. 2 King. 4.1.</note> as you uſe to do your children in caſe of poverty and diſtreſs. But
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170332:79"/>what proof can you make of this? produce the bill of divorce if you can; and let it be ſeen that you were unjuſtly put away. No, no; it was for your <hi>iniquities,</hi> your horrid injuſtice and violence, that you were ſold into the hands of cruel men; and it was for your <hi>tranſgreſsions,</hi> your whoredom, by Idolatry, that I put you away. I may rather complain of you (as it is ver. 2.) and ask, <hi>Wherefore when I came was there no man? When I called there was none to anſwer.</hi> Strange it was that there ſhould be no pious and upright men to be found among them but ſtranger it is that theſe wicked men ſhould have the boldneſs to argue with God, and plead their own inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. Sure the reaſon was none elſe but that which I have aſſigned; they had been lately reformed, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the captivity; the worſhip of God was much amended in the dayes of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> and they were not all faln back into ſo groſs idolatry, as formerly they had maintained. This, this was the very thing that immediately ruined them; this was it that would not let
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170332:80"/>them, ſee the miſchief that was coming upon them for their oppreſſion, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and ſuch like ſins; nor acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it juſt, when it was come. They held faſt this deceit (<hi>Jer.</hi> 8.7.) and ſo refuſed to return.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And this I conceive might <hi>make them interpret all the inſtances of Gods diſpleaſure againſt others, to the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of themſelves in their evil wayes, rather then to the awakening of their hearts to repentance. Ahaz</hi> the predeceſſor of their good King <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi> was delivered into the hand of the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> who ſmote him, and carried a great multitude captive into <hi>Damaſcus:</hi> and into the hand of the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who made a ſtrange ſlaughter among them, deſtroying an hundred and twenty thouſand valiant men in one day, and carrying away captive two hundred thouſand, men, women and children, which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be ſent home again, and gave more time unto for to amend. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.4, 5, 6. The <hi>Edomites</hi> alſo and the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> came and laid them waſte, and brought them very
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170332:80"/>low: The King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> likewiſe who was hired to relieve him, did but more diſtreſs, and not at all ſtrengthen him, ver. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. But they could eaſily impute all this evil which befell their Fathers unto their Idolatry, <hi>their offering incenſe unto other gods, and forſaking the God of their Fathers,</hi> ver. 25. As for themſelves, they were returned to him, and hated the ſtrange worſhip with all their hearts. How could they be in ſuch peril of being deſtroyed now they amended thoſe very faults for which their Fathers were ſcourged? This juſtice and righteouſneſs, which the melancholy Prophets called for, were (they might think) but Heathen vertues. The <hi>pure worſhip</hi> of God was that which diſtinguiſhed them from all others, and would ſecure them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any of that admired Pagan mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. And ſo the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that they were worſe then their heathen neighbours that were round about them; for they followed all their <hi>bad</hi> examples in worſhipping Idols, but not their <hi>good</hi> in doing juſtly and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170332:81"/>uprightly. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5.7. <hi>You have not walked in my ſtatutes, neither have kept my judgements, neither have done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the judgements of the Nations that are round about you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. And when God proceeded fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his judgements, and ſent all the ten tribes into captivity in the days of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> as you may read, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. this did not at all make them to ſtand in awe, and not to ſin. For the Anſwer was ready, They worſhipped the calves in <hi>Bethel;</hi> the <hi>remnant</hi> of them laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the meſſengers of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to ſcorn and mocked them, who were ſent to invite them to joyn in the reformation (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and therefore God caſt them out of their Land, and gave it unto others. But how any ſuch evil could betide thoſe that were the reformed, they could not tell how to imagine. What, would you have them believe that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then <hi>Samaria,</hi> and that the houſe of <hi>David</hi> ſhall not be more regarded then the houſe of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> or <hi>Jehu?</hi> Will not the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> whom they worſhipped, do more for them, then
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170332:81"/>
                  <hi>Baal</hi> or the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Gods could do for their Brethren? Yes ſurely, they were Gods beloved people, and no evil ſhould come near unto them. <hi>They were haughty becauſe of his holy moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Zephany</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.11. They bragged of Gods preſence with them, and of the care they had to keep his houſe clean from all heatheniſh impurities; and by this means they hugg'd themſelves in their injuſtice, and flattered their ſouls into a conceit of their acceptance with God, and ſecurity under him, though they had ſeen ſuch calamities befall others. Nay ſo ſottiſh were they that when they grew Idolatrous again af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all their reformations, yet becauſe they retained ſome devotion, they ſaid they were innocent; as you may ſee, Jer. 2.33, &amp;c. <hi>Why trimmeſt thou thy ſelf to ſeek love? Therefore haſt thou alſo taught thy wickedneſs,</hi> thy wayes. Or as the Vulgar reads it, <hi>Quid niter is bonam oſtendere viam tuam ad quaeren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam dilectionem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> Why doſt thou endeavour to purge and clear thy ſelf, as though thy way was good, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170332:82"/>thou hadſt no ſpot in thee, hoping hereby to obtain my favour? whereas thou haſt not only done evil thy ſelf, but taught it others alſo. And beſides thy Idolatry (ſpoken of before) <hi>in thy skirts</hi> (or wings) <hi>is found the blood of the ſouls of the poor innocents,</hi> which is ſo plain to be ſeen that one need not ſearch for it, <hi>ver.</hi> 34. As upon the wings of an Eagle or ſuch a bird of prey one ſhall find the blood of thoſe leſſer birds that they have devoured, ſo there were manifeſt marks &amp; tokens everywhere to be ſeen of their cruelty and injuſtice. And yet they have the face to come and ſay, <hi>ver.</hi> 35. <hi>I am innocent, Surely his anger ſhall be turned from me.</hi> The worſhip of God was that which they pretended, and they would not grant that they had gone after <hi>Baalim</hi> (as you may read, <hi>ver.</hi> 23.) and ſo they thought they might ſtand upon their own juſtification, not fearing the guilt of any other ſin but Idolatry.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Well; but when part of <hi>Judah</hi> her ſelf is gone into captivity, then ſure we ſhall hear a new ſtory and find a great change wrought in them. One
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170332:82"/>would not imagine but that he ſhould read how they were convinced when they ſaw Gods judgements come not only to their <hi>gates,</hi> but within their <hi>walls.</hi> But if you look into the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> you ſhall ſee that they who were left behind, and not yet car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away, remained in the very ſame ſins, and ſupported themſelves with the ſame falſe hopes. Beſides thoſe places formerly mentioned, I ſhall add theſe that ſpeak of their injuſtice and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. In <hi>chap.</hi> 7.10, 11. he ſaith the day of their deſtruction was near; the rod for their backs did bloſſome, and therefore would ere long bring forth its bitter fruits; which they might eaſily gather from hence, becauſe <hi>pride had budded among them, and violence was riſen up to a rod of wickedneſs. i. e.</hi> As their ſins encreaſed and grew to a greater hight, ſo would their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment grow more ripe, and no man <hi>ſhould be able to ſtrengthen himſelf in the iniquity of his life, ver.</hi> 13. Their ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and gold he ſaith, ſhould not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. but becauſe of their bloody crimes, he would bring the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170332:83"/>worſt of the heathen to poſſeſs their dwellings, <hi>ver.</hi> 23, 24. And <hi>chap.</hi> 8.17. he ſaith that to all their abominations which they committed, and as if they were not ſufficient, <hi>they filled the land with violence,</hi> and deviſed new wayes of heatheniſh worſhip alſo. But though they did ſo, and though God had done ſo already to part of their Nation, and threatned to expell them alſo from their land, <hi>yet they wearied themſelves with lyes,</hi> as it is, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.12. And what they were, you may gueſs from <hi>ver.</hi> 21.25. the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> was <hi>the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their ſtrength, the joy of their glory,</hi> and in this they truſted, and thought to be ſafe, though their devotions there were many of them Idolatrous.</p>
               <p>And more then this, they that were gone into captivity, would not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that there was any other cauſe of their expulſion but the prophaning of Gods worſhip; nor any thing more required to the pleaſing him then keeping of it pure; and ſo they ſtill retained their unrighteouſneſs under the cloak of ſerving God. The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> will bear witneſs to this alſo,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170332:83"/>
                  <hi>chap.</hi> 33. <hi>v.</hi> 31, 32, 33. <hi>They came and ſate before him as though they took a great deal of delight in hearing of Gods word, when as their hearts run after their cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs.</hi> Which words appear by the whole ſtory to have been ſpoken to them of the firſt captivity, and that after the taking of the City the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, <hi>ver.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I muſt add further, that this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple exalted themſelves to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of confidence in their evil wayes, that they turned good fellows (as we ordinarily ſpeak) and fell into drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs and gluttony by reaſon of their wealth and their ſecurity; See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.7, 8. Yea ſo haughty were they that they laught at the Prophets when they told them of thoſe Judgements that were coming upon them, and uſed to repeat their words with deriſion, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. The Prophets uſed to ſay <hi>thus hath the Lord commanded, and yet a little while</hi> and ſuch or ſuch a thing ſhall be. Now they imitate this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of theirs, and ſay <hi>manda, reman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> &amp;c. (as the Vulgar renders it) Command again and again if you will,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170332:84"/>let us have precept upon precept, bid us expect and look for ruine; though you ſay <hi>yet a little</hi> while, <hi>yet a little</hi> while (or nearer to our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, a little while for this thing here, and a little for the other there) and then the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> ſhall come, we fear it not. Therefore God ſaith, a people of ſtrange lips ſhould come and ſpeak to them, ſeeing they would not hear him, <hi>v.</hi> 11. and becauſe they would not <hi>refreſh the poor and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> (but rather oppreſs them) which he told them was the way to have peace, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. And that this is the meaning of this obſcure place, ſeems very probable from <hi>v.</hi> 14. where he calls them <hi>ſcorners,</hi> who ſaid <hi>ver.</hi> 15. that hell and death was at an agreement with them, ſo that they were as ſure they ſhould not dye, as if they had a leaſe of their lives. And though the overflowing ſcourge (ſpoken of <hi>chap.</hi> 8. 8.) ſhould come, yet they doubted not but they ſhould eſcape; for they made a refuge to themſelves. But as the Prophet tells them <hi>it was a refuge of lyes and hypocriſie,</hi> and Gods
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170332:84"/>judgements ſhould come upon them notwithſtanding their preſumptuous confidence, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. And do not think that the way to heaven is ſo wide that you can go between God and the world thither; do not think that the bed in which he layes his Spouſe is ſo broad that it will hold many lovers. <hi>Coanguſtatum enim eſt ſtratum, it a ut alter decidat,</hi> &amp;c. as the Vulgar Latin tranſlates the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, For <hi>the Bed is ſo ſtrait that it will not hold two but one muſt fall out; the covering is ſo ſhort that it will not wrap them both.</hi> Either God, or the world and all Idols, muſt be thruſt out; they cannot lye together with us, nor cannot he endure any companion in his love. Which is juſt like that of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, <hi>No man can ſerve two maſters,</hi> &amp;c. or that of St. <hi>Pauls, What agreement is there between Chriſt and</hi> Belial. And yet notwithſtanding all theſe admonitions, they minded nothing but to fortifie <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to repair the breaches in the walls, and to bring a moat about it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.9, 10, 11. and when God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for reformation, they betook
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170332:85"/>themſelves to their pleaſures, and were jolly and merry, as though no harm could befall them, <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13. And therefore God threatens, ver. 14. <hi>that this iniquity ſhould not be purged away till they dyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This prophane Spirit which taunted the Prophets was more fit for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Eſan</hi> then of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who as you read, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 21.11. call to the Watchman, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Prophet, and ask him <hi>What of the night? What of the night? i. e.</hi> what haſt thou now to ſay concerning the black night of affliction wherewith thou uſedſt to threaten us! we ſee no darkneſs, but it is a day of peace with us. To which he anſwers, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. True, the morning is before the night, but ere long your miſery will come; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you intend to amend, you had beſt do it preſently. But the ſeed of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did not only imitate them, but far exceed them; for in proceſs of time they arrived to ſuch an height of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety as to ſay in <hi>Joſiahs</hi> dayes, <hi>The Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil,</hi> Zeph. 1.12. And after the firſt captivity, when their iniquity was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170332:85"/>great, and the land was full of blood, and the City of perverſneſs; they ſaid. The Lord hath forſaken the earth; and the Lord ſeeth not, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.9. <hi>i. e.</hi> they thought there was no provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and that it came but by chance thar their brethren were carried cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, ſo that they might ſtill fare well enough.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But ſure when this party was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of their countrey alſo, and but ſome few of the poorer ſort left behind by the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> we ſhall find better dealings. And yet you muſt not expect it; for they thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that they ſhould increaſe and be ſtrong, becauſe they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> children. And thus they reaſoned with themſelves, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.24. that ſeeing their Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> though but one, had the land promiſed to him; they being many ſhould ſurely poſſeſs it, and have it for an inheritance, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially having eſcaped the deſtruction that was faln on others. But they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came guilty of the very ſame ſins that were formerly committed; <hi>For they ſhed blood, ver.</hi> 25. <hi>i. e.</hi> committed the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170332:86"/>violence, <hi>and they ſtood upon their ſword,</hi> v. 26. <hi>i. e.</hi> they hoped to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect themſelves by that which was the inſtrument of their violence, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ſuch like ſins as they practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. I wiſh heartily that all the men of the world at this day would take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample by thoſe that have been before them, and not think that they ſhall eſcape deſtruction becauſe they did not fall with others. God can do with them as he did with this remnant of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> whoſe doom read, <hi>ver.</hi> 27, 28. And above all I deſire that every one would apply theſe things to himſelf, and to this Nation which have been ſpoken of hypocriſie. For as far as we are parallel to them in our manner of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, muſt we expect the like puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be inflicted upon us. Beware therefore, Beware whoſoever thou art that readeſt theſe things, leaſt thou cheateſt thy ſelf with an hypocritical godlineſs, with a great deal of heat in ſome Religious duties, without the moſt exact and ſcrupulous juſtice and the bowels of tender mercy that the Goſpel requires of us. This deceit is
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170332:86"/>very common in the world, and more familiar then many are aware of; and yet withall ſo fatally deſtructive, that men had need to have a mark ſet up whereby to avoid this rock.</p>
               <p n="10">10. For you muſt not think but that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> alſo as well as the <hi>Jews</hi> were helped forward to their ruine by this falſhood. No queſtion but they thought their religion (as bad as it was) would preſerve them, and were ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of it, that with the very ſpoil of the poor they would ſerve their Gods. So you may read <hi>Amos</hi> 2.6 8. <hi>They ſold the righteous for ſilver,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See alſo <hi>Amos</hi> 4.1, 4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>and the poor for a pair of ſhoes; they were very corrupt in judgement, and they lay down upon clothes which they had in pledge by every Altar, and they drank the wine of the condemned in the houſe of their God; i. e.</hi> they ſerved God with thoſe things that they had ſo unjuſtly and violently gotten, and were content to ſpend ſomething upon him, ſo he would but wink at theſe unlawfull and cruel wayes of getting This iniquity would in all likelihood have ſtared them in the face and made them afraid, had it
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170332:87"/>not been for this fine deceit (this hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie which I ſpeak of) that their ſerving of God and keeping up his worſhip ſuch as it was, would be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of by God inſtead of all other things wherein they might be faulty. And ſo when <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſaith that the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers who loved gifts and bribes, <hi>ſhould be aſhamed becauſe of their ſacrifices</hi> when they were carried captive, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.18, 19. he clearly intimates that in <hi>theſe</hi> they truſted while they oppreſſed the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; but found themſelves miſerably deceived and diſappointed, as all ſuch men will be in ſuch weak ſupports.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And how far this peice of ſelf-coſenage prevailed in after times, when the Phariſees were in their greateſt height, I leave to thoſe to judge who read but thoſe paſſages in the Goſpel, <hi>of their making long prayers, faſting twice in the week, ſtrict obſervance of the Sabbath, and boaſting of their skill in the Law,</hi> while in the mean time they were the moſt groſs tranſgreſſors of the Law and diſhonourers of God. They thanked God that they were not Publicans, but were ſeparated by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170332:87"/>many ſtrictneſſes from the herd of men; and they ſaid with thoſe in <hi>Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, chap.</hi> 65.5. Stand by thy ſelf, come not near, <hi>for I am holier then thou,</hi> or as <hi>De Dieu</hi> interprets it (for there is no note of compariſon in the Hebrew) <hi>Sanctus ſum tibi, I am holy to thee.</hi> Thou being a common man maiſt not touch me, no more then thou maiſt the holy things. And yet theſe <hi>ſeeming Saints</hi> were unnatural to their parents; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured widdows houſes, abſolved men from their oaths, were full of extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ravening, and wickedneſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided the Sermons which our Saviour made, becauſe not ſorted to their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous humor. They would do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing indeed but what would ſtand with their worldly luſts and deſires; or elſe their own Fathers (whoſe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions they were ſo zealous of) would have taught them more goodneſs.

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170332:88"/>with the like diligence they ſhould keep them all. But for all this they have found a way to know this ſecret, and their rule is this, <hi>that the greater the puniſhment is for a tranſgreſſion of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi>

               <p n="12">12. Some ſuch thing it was that made them eſteem themſelves ſo highly in Gods favour for the obſervance of dayes and ceremonious worſhip, and made them think the breach of moral commands would not injure their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in his love; for to this day they
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170332:88"/>have a ſtrange opinion of the power that a right ſanctification of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath hath to reſtore them to their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient enjoyments.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. IT is time now to come to the third of thoſe four things that I ſaid were to be obſerved; which is this, <hi>That the hypocriſie and partial dealing</hi> (which was treated of in the former Chapter,) <hi>was cheriſhed by the Generality of the Prophets</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> who had exceedingly corrupted their ways and loved nothing better then filthy lucre. The ſtudy of the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> was to curry favour with the Rulers; and to pleaſe the people,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170332:90"/>which made them preach ſmooth do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, ſoft and oilely ſermons that ſhould never grate upon the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, leaſt they ſhould loſe their gain, or deminiſh their worldly advantages. And the <hi>Prieſts</hi> cared for no more but that the worſhip of God at the Temple might be maintained, that it might maintain then; that there might be a multitude of offerings and ſacrifices, whereby their fees might be increaſed and made more plentiful. And ſo both the one and the other of them made the nation believe they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and godly enough ſo long as they worſhiped not Idols though they did all thoſe other villanies that I have been ſpeaking of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the proof of this, you may read the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> who ſaith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.5. <hi>That they made Gods people to erre, and that when anything was put</hi> into their <hi>mouths, then they would cry peace; but</hi> if <hi>nothing</hi> were <hi>put into them, then againſt that man they</hi> would at all <hi>adventures proclaim war.</hi> He muſt be Gods enemy that was not a friend to their belly and purſe, and God could
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170332:90"/>do him no harm, that would be kind to them. Vnto which you may add that which you read <hi>v</hi> 11. of the ſame chapter, where the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> (we are told) made a trade of their office, and ſold their words, as the <hi>princes</hi> did of theirs, who ſold juſtice. With whom agrees the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> who was his contemporary as you may ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 56.10.11. Where he likens them to a company of hungry dogs, in regard of their greedineſs, covetouſneſs and inſatiable deſire of riches and pleaſure; but otherwiſe he ſaith they were like to ſleepy curs that bark at no body; or if they do lift up their head and give a yelp or two, lay themſelves down again in their ſweet ſlumber. <hi>i. e.</hi> They were careful for their own private concernments, but they would never reprove any for their wickedneſs; or if they did, it was ſo gently as if they were afraid to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe them. And ſo likewiſe the prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> teſtifies, <hi>Chap</hi> 4.8. <hi>that they eate the ſin of Gods people, and ſet their heart on their iniquity,</hi> i. e. They eat the <hi>ſin offering</hi> which was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:170332:92"/>for them to meddle withal if the blood was carried into the holy place; or they eat more of the ordinary ſin-offerings then they ſhould, feeding themſelves even with Gods portion, they ſet their heart on this iniquity; or rather they were glad not ſorrowful of the peoples ſins, and ſet their heart on the peoples iniquity, becauſe they eat of their ſin, and lived by the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices for it. They were ſo far from reproving the people for their faults, that they loved their ſins and rejoyced at their treſpaſſes, becauſe they would bring them in more large proviſions by the ſacrifices that were appointed for expiation of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> alſo lets us know that even ſuch perſons as they who ſhould have been the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the people, <hi>were guilty of ſheding the blood of the juſt in the midſt of Jeruſalem.</hi> Lam. 4.13. Their holy garments were ſtained with thoſe foule ſins of oppreſſion and cruelty; and they were as viſible upon them as in the reſt of the Nation. They cried up (it is likely) the purity of their Church,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170332:92"/>the holineſs of their ordinances, the devotion of their Rulers, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs of the people to divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and thence concluded without any farther ſcruple that God would not deſtroy ſuch a people as they were, and that the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould not come into ſuch an <hi>holy City. They ſaid even unto thoſe that deſpiſed the</hi> Lord, <hi>You ſhall have</hi> peace; <hi>and unto every one that walked after</hi> the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>of his own heart, No evil ſhall come</hi> upon you. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.17. Every one from the leaſt even unto the greateſt was given unto covetouſneſs; from the Prophet even unto the prieſt every one dealt falſly; For they healed the hurt of the daughter of Gods people ſlighly, ſaying peace peace when there was no peace. <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.10, 11. And <hi>were they aſhamed when they had committed</hi> all theſe abominations? <hi>Nay, they were not at all aſhamed, neither could they bluſh,</hi> v. 12. If you would know the reaſon of this confidence, it is apparent that they imagined they were holy perſons, and ſaid, <hi>We are wiſe, and the law of the Lord is with us,</hi> v. 8.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170332:93"/>which words ſignifie that they laid the greateſt weight of their hopes upon that piece of Religion which hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to God, though they had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect at all in their actions towards the good of one another. And the very ſame words you ſhall find in another place <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 13, 14, 15. and that which deceived them, was, their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices wherein they truſted, as you may gather from <hi>v.</hi> 20. where God ſaith, <hi>To what purpoſe cometh there to me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe from</hi> Sheba? <hi>and the ſweet cane from a far</hi> countrey? Your <hi>burnt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are not acceptable, nor</hi> your ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>ſweet to me.</hi> And you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve alſo that when theſe prophets could not avoid but they muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of ſome evil that ſo they might imitate the true prophets and not be ſuſpected for meer flatterers by ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of nothing but peace and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; <hi>then they ſaw for them falſe burdens and cauſes of baniſhment,</hi> Lam. 2.14 Some little miſchief or other they foretold ſhould come if they did not amend; ſome ſmall burden they laid upon them which the people did not
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170332:93"/>much dread; and ſo their threatnings were but mock burdens, like the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof of flatterers who ſmile while they give them; like the Dogs (<hi>Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> ſpoke of) who when they ſeem to bite their maſters, they do not faſt en their teeth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Unto this you may add the words of <hi>Ezek. Chap.</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 25, 28, 29. where he tells us of the defection which both prieſts, prophets, princes and people had made from God, ſo that there was not ſo much as a man among the people to make up the hedge and to ſtand in the gapp againſt the wrath of God, which had made a breach upon them. And particularly he ſaith of the <hi>prophets</hi> and <hi>prieſts that they were like ravening Lyons, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured ſouls, made many widdows, dawbed with untempered morter, ſeen vanity and divined lyes.</hi> Let me intreat you to read the whole 13. <hi>Chap.</hi> where he relates how the Prophet &amp; Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs <hi>ſeduced the people preaching peace, when there was</hi> no <hi>peace, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening the hands of the wicked that he ſhould not return from his wicked way, by
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170332:94"/>promiſing of him life.</hi> The <hi>prophets</hi> they promiſed the people ſecurity and built an imaginary wall of defence about them <hi>v.</hi> 10. The <hi>propheteſſes</hi> they bid them be as quiet and at as much eaſe as men are when they leane their arms on a cuſhion; And if any mans head did but ache, they had a kerchief for it to bind it about, and make him ſleep in ſecurity without any fear of danger. <hi>v.</hi> 18. And all this unfaithfulneſs to ſouls they were guilty of for the vileſt, the ſmalleſt gain imaginable; <hi>For an handful</hi> of <hi>barly</hi> or <hi>a bit of bread</hi> they would pollute Gods, name and ſlay poor ſouls that depended on them. <hi>v.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And more then this, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the true prophets who dealt ſincerely with the people and told them the great danger that was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending over them. One place in the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> may ſerve inſtead of all for the atteſting of this charge againſt them, which is <hi>Chap.</hi> 26. where they accuſe him to the Princes for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but becauſe he prophecied deſtruction to them. <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9.</p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:170332:94"/>
               <p>Some of the <hi>Elders</hi> indeed were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with his propheſie, and brought for his juſtification in what he had ſaid, the example of <hi>Micah,</hi> who had ſpoken the ſame words in the time of <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi> and yet that King did not put him to death, but feared the Lord, and laboured for a reformation, <hi>ver.</hi> 18, 19.</p>
               <p>But then the people have their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to oppoſe to this, (in <hi>ver.</hi> 20. which ſeems to be their words) How that <hi>Urijah</hi> had lately taken the ſame bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to propheſie in the preſent Kings reign againſt their City, but the King would not endure it, but though he fled into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> yet he ſent after him and brought him home, and ſlew him with the ſword in a diſgracefull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And it ſhould ſeem that had not <hi>Ahikam</hi> reſolutely ſtood his friend, this laſt ſtory had prevailed againſt <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah, ver.</hi> 24. And in the next chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we read that ſome of them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to propheſie that ſhortly the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the Lords houſe ſhould be brought again from <hi>Babylon</hi> that had been lately carried thither. And though <hi>Jeremiah</hi> aſſured them of the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170332:95"/>vanity of this aſſertion, yet in the next after that, <hi>chap.</hi> 28. there aroſe a Prophet, who to pleaſe the people aſſigns the punctual time when it ſhould be done; and out of a great conceit ſure that they were Gods beloved people, whatſoever did befall them; there aroſe Prophets in <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> among them of the firſt captivity, who foretold the ſame things with thoſe at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as you may ſee <hi>chap.</hi> 29. In ſo much that it became a Proverb among thoſe that were left ſtill there, that another captivity would never come, whatſoever the Prophets ſaid, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 12.22, 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And they plainly intimate, <hi>Ier.</hi> 18.18. that they had as good Prophets as he, and ſhould alwayes have, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he propheſied their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and therefore ſeeing they could well ſpare him, they deviſed how to diſpatch him out of the way, that he might not trouble them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But theſe Prophets who made the people believe the captivity ſhould never come, did themſelves firſt feel the burden of it before any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170332:95"/>The wall of defence, that bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark of ſecurity that they built for them in their Sermons being laid toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and daubed with untempered morter, it fell down upon them that daubed it, ſo that it was ſaid, <hi>This Wall is no more, neither they that daubed it,</hi> Ezek. 13.15, 16. And theſe two things are remarkable in another viſion of his (<hi>chap.</hi> 9.) where he ſees the <hi>ſlayers</hi> ſent forth to deſtroy all thoſe in the City that did not ſadly bewail the ſins of it. <hi>Firſt</hi> that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> were firſt puniſhed; for he bids him <hi>begin at the Sanctuary,</hi> and it is ſaid they ſlew the Elders which were there, and ſo went forth and ſlew in the City, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That they were all ſlain and deſtroyed, none of them being ſpared; for though they are bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to mark ſome in the City, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. yet you read of none to be marked in the Sanctuary. And therefore <hi>Ezekiel</hi> complains as he if was left alone, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>i. e.</hi> in <hi>viſion</hi> he was preſent at this ſlaughter made among the Miniſters in the Sanctuary, and he could ſee no Prieſt remaining there but himſelf. So
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170332:96"/>dangerous a thing it is to have a form of godlineſs without the power of it actuating the whole ſoul, that ſuch perſons run themſelves into deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by their falſe hopes and dreams of Gods favour; and bring likewiſe all their credulous admirers, and thoſe that hang upon their lips, into an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected ruine with them. I ſhall not preſume ſo far as to tell you what examples we have of this in our age of the world; but paſs to the fourth thing obſervable, which ſhall be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpatched, becauſe I have ſtaid ſo long upon the two former.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>From hence you may perceive the reaſon why they did ſo caſily upon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion revolt from God and fall to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try again.</hi> They were but half reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and retained the very root of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry in their hearts; and therefore rather then ſuffer any thing from the diſpleaſure of a new King, they would ſet up the falſe worſhip again, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of his Religion. For ſo you may ſee that after <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time who had made a great change among them, <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> and the people with him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170332:96"/>to their Idols; and after <hi>Joſiah,</hi> it is the complaint of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> that they went a whoring from God. Now what reaſon can be aſſigned for this, but that their hearts were rotten, and though they prided themſelves in a Religion, yet it was that which they did not underſtand; or love upon any other account but as it did maintain them in their preſent covetouſneſs and violence? Whence it came to paſs that the ſame covetous affections made them change their Religion when there was no other way to ſerve them. And as their reformation in Religion was ſometimes a cloak for their covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſo in proceſs of time their cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs made them think any religion to be good enough, and to debauch the worſhip of God without any alteration of their confidence. And this run them alſo upon another miſchief, which was, that when they had forgotten God, and principles of Conſcience, though they were confident, yet it was in the power and ſtrength of men rather then in God, who uſed to defend them mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velouſly. <hi>Is</hi> Iſrael <hi>a ſervant</hi> (ſaith
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170332:97"/>
                  <hi>Ieremy, chap.</hi> 2 14.) <hi>is he an home-born ſlave? i. e.</hi> doth not God care how he uſes him, or what miſery he expoſes him unto, as men do with their ſlaves that they have full poſſeſſion of? Is he not Gods ſon, yea his firſt born? <hi>but how then comes it to paſs that he is ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi> The Prophet anſwers that indeed both <hi>Aſſyria</hi> and <hi>Aegypt</hi> had devoured him, <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16. but it was his own fault who forſook his God, and ſought to thoſe for help who rather did him harm, <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 18. And ſo it will be with every one (as it was with him, <hi>ver.</hi> 19.) who betakes himſelf to evil courſes to defend what he hath as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly gotten: <hi>His own wickedneſs ſhall correct him, and his back-ſlidings ſhall reprove him; he ſhall know that it is an evil thing and a bitter that he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the Lord, and that his fear is not in him.</hi>

AND now leaving theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations to every mans pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate conſideration, I ſhall paſs to the <hi>Second</hi> General truth which I promiſed to illuſtrate, and that is this; <hi>That theſe were the ſins which the Prophets note this people to have been guilty of after they were returned out of their captivity, and when an amendment might juſtly have been expected. Ezekiel</hi> who had ſeen
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170332:98"/>the Glory of the Lord depart from the Temple, and ſo his protection from the Nation (as you read before, <hi>ch.</hi> 9.) doth propheſie likewiſe of its return again, and in a viſion he beheld it coming in at that gate where it went out, and ſeating it ſelf in the new houſe of God, which he deſcribes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.3, 4, 5. Juſtice and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude would make us now think that they would never offend God in ſuch manner as their Fathers had done; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially after they had felt ſo long dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by the departure of the divine glory from their land. But yet as if theſe ſins had been transfuſed into them with their parents ſeed, they would not croſs the old Proverb, <hi>Like Father, like Son,</hi> treading in their ſteps, and leaving the like example to their poſterity. Very devout they were (for ought that we can read) in their Religious worſhip; no complaints are brought in againſt them for not keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sabbath, not praying, faſting, and offering Sacrifice: But they knew themſelves ſo punctual in theſe things, that they ſlided into the ſame deceit
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170332:98"/>wherein their Fathers were caught and periſhed. They imagined that thoſe things were all the reverence that was to be performed to the divine glory which dwelt among them, and that it would not be offended with their unjuſt and unmercifull dealings. For in the very beginning of this Propheſie of <hi>Zachary</hi> (where we begun this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe) he crys out chap. 1. v. 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, Turn you, turn you unto me; Be not ye as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, unto whom the former Prophets cryed the very ſame words; who though they would not hearken then, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards were forced to acknowledge when Gods words took hold of them, that they were puniſhed according to their doings.</hi> And this was when the captivity was expired, that he made this proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto them; whereby we may judge that they were not converted when God had turned their captivity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And indeed God foreſaw what would be their practice, and wherein they would beſtow their greateſt cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; And therefore many years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this deliverance he labours to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170332:99"/>the obſervance of theſe neglected duties when it ſhould be vouchſafed to them. For before he warns them a word about their ſacrifices by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> he gives the Princes a great charge about matters of juſtice, equity and kind dealing, as you may read <hi>Ezek.</hi> 45.8, 9, 10, 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then there immediately follows a large direction about their offerings and feaſts that they ſhould obſerve, in the latter end of that chapter, and part of the next. But as he begun, ſo he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that diſcourſe, with a buſineſs that concerns juſtice, Ezek. 46.18. <hi>The Prince ſhall not take the peoples in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance by oppreſsion, to thruſt them out of their poſſeſsion,</hi> &amp;c. And yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but take notice that they were horribly faulty in theſe things, though the Laws of ſacrifice which they care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully kept, were invironed with cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about them. For <hi>Zachary</hi> plainly tells us that robbery and perjury (two moſt groſs ſins) did ſtill reign among them, and to make them more provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, they ſaid notwithſtanding that they were innocent. So <hi>Iunius</hi> reads
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170332:99"/>thoſe words, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>This is the curſe that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth; for every one that ſteals of this people, ſaith, as it,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> as the reſt of the earth) <hi>I am innocent: and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſweareth of this people ſaith, as it, that he is innocent. i. e.</hi> They were no more ſenſible of theſe ſins then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Heathen people who knew but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of God, and ſo might more eaſily forget what was only taught them by themſelves. But in our tranſlation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is a threatning, and thus it may be expounded (as <hi>De Dieu</hi> hath noted) moſt agreeably to the Hebrew text, <hi>He that ſteals is cut off on this ſide</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> of the flying roul) <hi>according to it</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the curſe) <hi>and he that ſwears is cut off on the other ſide according to it.</hi> The roul or book that he ſpeaks of, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. which contained a curſe in it, threatned upon all <hi>Iudea</hi> (which was as the roul, longer then broad) was to fly abroad and ſpread it ſelf upon all the guilty perſons. Now one ſide of the Book (ſaith he) contains a curſe againſt all thieves, which ſhall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly light upon them and the other ſide
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170332:100"/>of it againſt all falſe ſwearers, which ſhall alſo come upon them according as is threatned. And therefore he goes on further to denounce Gods judgements upon ſuch perſons, <hi>v.</hi> 4. and ſpeaking of the woman that ſate in the midſt of the Epaph, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. (by whom was ſhadowed the people of the land, whoſe iniquities ſhould be born withal but to a certain meaſure,) he ſaith <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>this is</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> i. e. <hi>iniquity it ſelf, the mother of all deceit, thefts and perjuries:</hi> And for this he threatens again unto them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expulſion and diſperſion into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Babylon,</hi> as you may ſee in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing part of the chapter. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward God having moſt plainly told them how the caſe ſtood with their Fathers, and how angry he had been with them, <hi>chap.</hi> 8.2. he ſaith, <hi>that now he was returned to</hi> Zion, <hi>and would dwell in the midſt of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and it ſhould be a City of truth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. And he tells them what great things he would do for them, and that as they had been a curſe, ſo now they ſhould be a bleſſing, <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> &amp; <hi>v.</hi> 13. But
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170332:100"/>then He adds that theſe are the things they muſt do; <hi>Speak ye every one the truth to his neighbour, execute the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of peace and truth in your gates; and let none of you imagine evil in your hearts againſt his neighbour; and love no falſe oath: For all theſe are things that I hate, ſaith the Lord,</hi> ver. 16, 17.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And if we look back to <hi>Haggai</hi> who propheſied but two years before theſe words in the eighth of <hi>Zachary</hi> were ſpoken (one being in the ſecond, the other in the fourth year of <hi>Darius</hi>) he will tell us no better news of this people. For he ſaith, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>That every thing that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did take in hand, was as unclean and polluted as that which was touched by one defiled with a dead body, and that though they were an holy people to him, yet that did not make the things that they medled withall holy.</hi> Now if we compare this paſſage with thoſe that were before ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of <hi>Zachary,</hi> we ſhall eaſily diſcern I think what the matter was that made God ſo offended with their doings. At firſt they let the Temple of the Lord lye waſte, and builded
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170332:101"/>their own houſes after their return from captivity before they built it, though God had given them a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to go about it. But of this neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect they were awakened by theſe two Prophets, and by many judgements and ſore afflictions mentioned, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.15, 16, 17. and <hi>Zach.</hi> 8.9, 10. And then they thought all was well, becauſe they obeyed Gods voice in this thing, and becauſe he promiſed from that day forward to bleſs them, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.19. So the Temple were but carried on to perfection, they thought no great care was due to other things, and ſo continued in a world of wickedneſs, making their zeal for Temple-work eat up all their love to juſtice and mercy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If we ſhould trace their foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps further, we ſhould ſoon find that when the Temple was compleated and finiſhed, they were but little better. For <hi>Malachy</hi> who concludes their ſtory in the Old Teſtament (and is called by them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>the ſeal of the Prophets,</hi> becauſe he was the laſt and ſhuts up all) complaining of the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170332:101"/>iniquity both of Prieſt and people, ſets down theſe ſins as famous among the reſt, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Falſe ſwearing, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the hireling in his wages, of the widdow and fatherleſs; and turning aſide the ſtranger from his right,</hi> all which they did without any fear of what would follow. And particularly of the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> he tells us that <hi>they were partial in the Law,</hi> chap. 2.9. <hi>i. e.</hi> they did not judge according to the merit of the cauſe, but according to their love of the perſon. And of the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> we are told by <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> how hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily they oppreſſed the people, by exacting uſury of them, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. By which together with the dearth they became ſo poor, that it was the cauſe (I believe) of their detaining the tythes from the Levites, <hi>chap.</hi> 13.10. and that they were tempted to rob God him ſelf as the Princes rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed them, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.8. To which add the great violence that they all offered to their wives, either putting of them quite away, (as ſome underſtand the place) or elſe taking others to them (which was worſe for their poor
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170332:102"/>wives) &amp; theſe <hi>the daughters of a ſtrange God, Mal.</hi> 2.11. This you know they had begun to do preſently after their return out of captivity, and upon the ſerious admonition of <hi>Ezra</hi> repented of it; but it ſhould ſeem that they fell into the ſame ſin again in after times, and that ſo univerſally, and ſo much to the injury of their wives, that they <hi>cauſed the Altar of the Lord to be cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with tears, with weeping and with crying out, inſomuch that he regarded not their offerings any more,</hi> &amp;c. Mal. 2.13. <hi>i. e.</hi> their wives made ſuch grievous complaints to the Lord of the violence that was offered them (ſo it is called, <hi>ver.</hi> 16.) that it cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to deſpiſe all their gifts that they brought him; he looking more at the others tears, then at all their ſacrifices. And yet they have the front to come and ask God wherefore he would not receive them, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. To which he anſwers, that he muſt deal righteouſly though they would not, and he could not but take notice how treacherouſly they had dealt with their wives, who as they had been their
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170332:102"/>companions merited greater <hi>kindneſs</hi> from them, and as they were taken by Covenant and contract, they were in <hi>juſtice</hi> obliged to have dealt better with them. And he proves that it muſt needs be a great offence, becauſe it was ſo contrary to Gods inſtitution in marriage; for <hi>did not he make one, and yet he had the reſidue of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>i. e.</hi> according as we tranſlate it Did not he make one wife only for <hi>Adam,</hi> whereas he having more the ſame ſpirit that he breathed into her, could have made many, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or if we render it with others: Did not be who is <hi>one</hi> make it (<hi>i. e.</hi> the covenant of marriage) and he hath abundance of ſpirit ſtill to breath into our ſeed. And wherefore did that <hi>one</hi> make that order that a man ſhould cleave to his wife, but that he might have a godly ſeed? and therefore take heed what you do in putting away your wives, and taking others; for hereby you offend him that breaths the ſpirit of life into us. Or if we take it as others inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it, their wickedneſs is ſtill argued to be the greater, becauſe they boaſted
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170332:103"/>that they were the children of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Now <hi>Did that one</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the firſt of your family) <hi>do ſo, of whoſe ſpirit we are the reſidue? and what did that one? he ſought a godly ſeed,</hi> he put not away <hi>Sarah</hi> though ſhe was barren (which to you would ſeem a juſt cauſe) nor matched with an Idolater, that he might have iſſue. Or if we receive that rendring of the words which the learned <hi>De Dieu</hi> prefers above all the reſt, it argues them of great inhumani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that they had not common good nature in them, which makes the ſin ſtill greater. <hi>No one would do thus that had but any reliques of the ſpirit of God in him, and therefore much leſs they that ſeek a godly ſeed,</hi> as you pretend to do. You ſee that he might well call this <hi>covering violence with his garment, ver.</hi> 16. becauſe it was ſuch a wrong to thoſe that by the Laws of God and nature deſerved better at their hands. <hi>To ſpread ones garment,</hi> or ones skirts over a woman, is a phraſe in holy writ for to marry her, <hi>Ruth</hi> 3.9. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.8. By taking therefore of a ſtrange wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man into their ſociety, which was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170332:103"/>before to another, they did as it were marry to violence, and contract a relation with injuſtice. Or as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named author thinks it ſhould be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, <hi>Violence covered their garments, i. e.</hi> when as they ought ſtill to have caſt their garments of love and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection over their wives violence and wrong did cover thoſe garments; their marriage was an act of injuſtice, and their skirts which they ſpread over ſtrangers, were all over ſtained with cruelty, hard-heartedneſs and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And <hi>Zachary</hi> tells us by way of propheſie, what ſhould be in after times toward the end of this Nation and what manner of Rulers ſhould be over the people. He compares their Shepherds, <hi>i. e.</hi> Governours (as I have ſhewn before) unto <hi>young Lyons,</hi> who do not uſe to protect but to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vour the ſheep, <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.3. And he calls the people <hi>the flock of ſlaughter, ver.</hi> 4. (whom he is bid to inſtruct) either becauſe they were to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the armies of their enemies or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were a prey unto their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours;
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170332:104"/>According as it follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Their poſſeſſors ſlay them, and they hold themſelves not guilty.</hi> Yea to ſuch a confidence were they arrived in theſe ſins, that they <hi>Bleſs God</hi> for the riches which they had got in this ſort. They had ſome devotion you ſee left, though no honeſty nor goodneſs. God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled to all wicked poſſeſſions and acquiſitions, that he may make them good, and defend them againſt all the clamors of men, and the ſuits of their own conſcience. And it ſeems the people were very bad alſo, for <hi>ver.</hi> 6. he threatens them that he would have no more pitty on them then their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers had, but let them deſtroy one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſeditions, and at laſt deliver them all into the hands of <hi>the King</hi> that oppreſſed them, who ſhould be ſo far from taking any paſtoral care of them, that he ſhould only ſlay and devour them, as you may read, <hi>v.</hi>

               <p n="6">6. And ſome underſtand by that King the <hi>Roman Caeſar</hi> to whom they made themſelves a prey by ſuch ſins as thoſe I have been treating of. That long Captivity which indures to this
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170332:104"/>day, had its way prepared by their ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice and cruelty, as thoſe acquaint us upon whom the ſpirit of prophecy was again poured forth. <hi>For our Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reproving the chief of that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration when he lived, for devouring wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows houſes, for extortion, rapine and blood; for covetouſneſs and oppreſsion, for being without natural affection, and the like ſins; while they made long pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and pretended a great deal of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and religion:</hi> He declaring alſo that <hi>faith, judgement, mercy and the love of God were more to be regarded then their ſtrict obſervation of dayes, and the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſacrifices;</hi> They out of a great zeal for their religion which they thought he did not ſpeak honourably enough concerning, moſt ſhamefully put him to death I believe they took themſelves to be very religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and were zealous in what they did; only their zeal was not equally diſpenſed nor conveyed alike through the whole body of duties that God commanded. Their heat was like the fluſhing in mens faces, or the burning in their hands, which we do not take
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170332:105"/>to be an argument of a good temper; but rather a ſign that there are obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions (as the ordinary language calls them) in the body, ſo that there is not a free motion of the vital blood in all the parts. I mean, they ſpent ſo much zeal in a few things, that they left no warmth of affection for other moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary duties. In thoſe things their heat was ſtaid and ſtopt, which made them of an extraordinary high colour, and to have the repute in the world of very great Saints and moſt vertuous perſons. Yea they themſelves gazed ſo much upon this flame that they took no notice how cold they were in matters of common honeſty, but they committed all iniquity, in a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble belief that they were good men, and moſt beloved of God. Their great zeal for the Sabbath and ſuch like matters made them take themſelves for pious and devout perſons: but the partiality and particularity of it (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it remained there confined) made them really to be ſuch as our Saviour calls Hypocrites; which appellation they took in ſuch diſdain, that they

So unjuſt indeed they were, that they hated all good men, and cared not whether there was one of them left in the world, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. But eſpecially conſider, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.2. which
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170332:108"/>hath been explained before (<hi>chap.</hi> 6.) to ſignifie that the people of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> ſhould be ſlaughtered juſt as their ſacrifices wherein they truſted for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation were at the Altar. Now if you look into <hi>ver.</hi> 21. you will ſee what their ſins were; <hi>unjuſt dealing, and laying hold of every occaſion to ruine their neighbour, and contriving wayes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap him.</hi> And it is remarkable that ſuch as their ſin was, ſuch was their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. As they were unſatiable in their covetouſneſs and thirſt after wealth, ſo were their enemies unſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their appetite to devour them. For he ſaith <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8. that their enemies ſhall be as an hungry man that thinks his belly is full in a dream, but awakes and finds his ſtomack to be ſharp let by reaſon of emptineſs. They had a kind of dog-like appetite; all their cruelties wherewith one would have thought their anger would have been ſatisfied, being but like a dream in compariſon of thoſe that were behind. As their thirſt of unjuſt gain ſtill uſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe; and the more they had the more they deſired to have: ſo was it with
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170332:109"/>their enemies thirſt after their blood; one draught that might be thought enough to quench it was but a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a larger, and made them more greedy of it. Read likewiſe <hi>Jer</hi> 5.25, 26, 27, 28, 29 and <hi>Jer</hi> 7.28, 29 where after he had ſaid, <hi>Truth is periſhed and cut off from their mouth,</hi> it follows, <hi>Cut off thine hair O</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and caſt it away,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> he proclaims a captivity which ſhould be a cauſe of grievous mourning and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation to them. And ſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 21.12, 13. He calls for ſpeedy execution of judgement, or elſe his anger ſhould break forth like fire againſt them, and though mount <hi>Sion</hi> was ſtrong as a rock, yet they muſt not think that it ſhould be able to defend them without <hi>juſtice,</hi> which (as I ſaid) is a rampart ſtronger then a wall of rocks and mountains.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And let me here before I proceed further, take notice how angry God was with the injuſtice of their Kings and Governours, and deſtroyed them for it. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> compares their two Kings <hi>Jehojakim</hi> and <hi>Jehojachin</hi> to two <hi>young Lyons</hi> who did devour and tear the people in pieces, <hi>chap.</hi> 9.3, 6 and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170332:109"/>therefore he takes up a lamentation over them, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. and ſayes that they were deſtroyed juſt as they uſed to do wild beaſts which they took in pits made for that purpoſe. The one of them was taken by the King of <hi>Aegypt, ver.</hi> 4. and the other by the King of <hi>Babylon, ver.</hi> 9. that they might no more catch any prey upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And hereby the ſtrength and power of that Nation was much impaired, there being no ſtrong rod to be a ſcepter to rule, <hi>v.</hi> 14. as ſhall further appear in the next ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. It is ſuch a monſtrous thing for thoſe who are the Conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators of right and juſtice to tranſgreſs it, that God cannot but puniſh ſuch miſdemeanors, he being the ſupream moderator of all, who will ſee that right take place. They are <hi>Gods</hi> here below, and ſhould act his part among men, which if they do not, it belongs properly to him to chaſtiſe them, and turn them out of their office. And he will do it, becauſe they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſins ſo contrary to the end of their inſtitution, and ſo diſagreeing to the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170332:110"/>nature and being of the office they bear. So ſtrange and monſtrous a thing it is for Rulers to violate juſtice, that the ſon of <hi>Sirach</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 20.4. <hi>it is like the luſt of an Eunuch to deflour a virgin,</hi> i. e. not only a treacherous but a moſt unnaturall thing. <hi>Juſtice</hi> is ordinarily compared by all Authors to a <hi>virgin;</hi> and therefore (1) It muſt be kept pure, chaſte and uncorrupted; and (2) for that end it is committed to the charge of Judges and other offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, as Virgins in the Eaſtern coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries uſed to be intruſted to Eunuchs who waited upon them; but then (3) Theſe Judges and Rulers muſt be as far from corrupting juſtice as an Eunuch is from vitiating of a Virgin; or (4) If they do <hi>conſtruprare juſtitiam</hi> (as <hi>Tertullians</hi> phraſe is) commit a rape upon right and juſtice, it cannot but be looked upon as a ſtrange act of violence. For as God and nature for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid ſuch a force by an Eunuch, ſo do God and man forbid it in a King or a Judge. And (5) If they prove guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſuch an unnatural ſin, they ſhall endure the puniſhment that ſuch
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170332:110"/>wretched perſons were condemned unto; God will not ſpare them above all other men. To this purpoſe <hi>Delrio</hi> on that place, notes out of <hi>Janſenius</hi> and others.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And now for the <hi>ſecond captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of <hi>Judah,</hi> we ſhall ſoon ſee to what cauſe it was to be imputed. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> tells us in the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> chapter of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie thar <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> like a great Eagle had carried away to his own country the higheſt branch of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> i. e. <hi>Jeconiah</hi> the King of <hi>Judah,</hi> who was firſt carried captive by him, <hi>v.</hi> 3. And this <hi>Eagle</hi> only left a <hi>little ſeed</hi> which was <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> whoſe Kingdom could not grow any ſtronger or higher then a <hi>Vine,</hi> becauſe overtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and oppreſſed by the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> who caſt a dark and cold ſhadow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. Now <hi>Zedekiah</hi> took an oath to be true to the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> who had planted him in the Kingdom, as you may ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14. But he hoping to riſe to a greater ſtrength and talneſs then the ſtature of a <hi>Vine,</hi> and beholding another Eagle (which was the King of <hi>Aegypt</hi>) under whoſe
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170332:111"/>protection he imagined that he might ſpread and dilate himſelf; we read <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8, 15. that this Vine inclined her branches, and ſhot her roots towards him that he might water it and make it grow great by helping it from the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the <hi>Chaldeans.</hi> But for this falſeneſs and breach of Covenant God was no leſs angry then <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> and threatens to pull it up by the roots, and make every leaf of it wither, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>i. e.</hi> utterly deſtroy the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> and to leave none of them to bear rule in the land, as you may read from the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to the end of the one and twentieth ver. where you may ſee the ſin that he denounces this judgement upon, <hi>is breach of promiſe, and much more violation of his eath and covenant,</hi> which he took ſo hainouſly that it is repeated five times as the cauſe of their ruine, <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16, 18, 19, 20. And God calls it not only <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> oath, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. but his <hi>own oath</hi> which was deſpiſed, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. And it is again repeated, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.23. as a thing that God could not forget but for which he brought the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> againſt
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170332:111"/>them. And if you compare <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.4. with 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.4. you will find that this piece of unjuſtice in ſwearing falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and breaking covenants, was a ſin that brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> alſo to ruine. There is but one place more that I ſhall note, which concerns this captivity of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> and it is <hi>Jer.</hi> 34. Where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet calls upon them to <hi>let the Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Hebrew Nation go free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law in that behalf.</hi> And they promiſed by a ſolemn covenant that they would yield obedience; but afterward became doubly guilty by breaking their promiſe, and keeping their Brethren ſtill in ſlavery. Now ſee what God threatens becauſe of this oppreſſion and tranſgreſſion of their covenant, <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 18, 19, 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No leſs then a totall extirpation of them out of their land, if not out of the land of the living by the ſword, peſtilence and famine. And to this I am apt to think that paſſage relates which we meet withall in the very beginning of <hi>Jeremy's</hi> lamentations, <hi>Judah is gone into captivlty, becauſe of affliction, and becauſe of great ſervitude,</hi> chap. 1.3.</p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:170332:112"/>
               <p n="6">6. And now if any one hath a liſt to look into the ſtate of other Nations mentioned in the Scripture ſtory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe, he will find the deſtruction of them all attributed to the fatal influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that theſe ſins had upon them. <hi>Tyre</hi> a neighbour countrey, called the <hi>total ſumm of all beauty</hi> (Ezek. 28.12.) <hi>that walked in the midſt of the ſtones of fire,</hi> (v. 14.) <hi>i. e.</hi> of pretious ſtones and Jewels that ſparkled on every ſide of her; and that was like an <hi>Angel</hi> for glory and bravery, and as a <hi>Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> for ſtrength and ſafety (<hi>v.</hi> 16.18.) this famous and perfect City cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted her ſelf by violence, covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, deceit in her traffique which ſhe anciently had abhorred, and then God brought a fire to devour her, <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16, 18, 19. She flouriſhed you there read after a wonderfull manner till iniquity was found in her, and then (as it is <hi>chap.</hi> 26.14.) ſhe became like the top of a rock, a place to ſpread nets upon. And thus ſhe lay for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty years as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> did; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> tells us, <hi>chap.</hi> 23.17. by whom you muſt interpret thoſe words
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170332:112"/>in <hi>Ezekiel, that ſhe ſhould be built no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. And leaſt you ſhould think that theſe things concerned only <hi>Judah</hi> and ſome of her next door neighbours who might have ſome report of their Laws; but did not bode ſo ſadly to other more remote Nations where theſe ſins are found; Take further into your conſideration what God ſaies of <hi>Ninive,</hi> which City had been a great hammer or maul in the times of the Aſſyrian Kings unto <hi>Judea</hi> and other countreys. And you find that theſe ſins beat her to duſt, and ſlew thoſe Lion-like Kings though they filled their holes with prey, and their dens with ravine, and thought to bring up their whelps, <hi>i. e.</hi> their ſons to the ſame trade of devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <hi>Nahum.</hi> 2.11, 12, 13. and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hum</hi> 3.1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God ſent one of thoſe Lyons, <hi>(viz. Senacherib)</hi> againſt the <hi>Hypocritical Nation,</hi> that I have been deſcribing, and gave him charge to take the ſpoil and the prey of it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.56. But he thought of nothing but <hi>deſtroying and cutting off</hi> Nations not a few, <hi>ver.</hi> 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:170332:113"/>God threatens to deſtroy him utterly, and to take off his burdens and yoke from his peoples neck, <hi>v.</hi> 26, 27. This he did by the hand of the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> who broke the Aſſyrian Empire in pieces, but yet ſucceeded them in cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, and ravening, covetouſneſs and unmercifulneſs, taking all for fiſh that came to their net, according as the Kings of <hi>Nineve</hi> did, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.15. and therefore they drunk of the ſame cup of his indignation, as you may read, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 13.19, 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.3, 4, 5, 6. where he notes <hi>the hard bondage wherewith he made the conquered to ſerve, and their oppreſsion, and ruling the Nations in anger, as cauſes of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi> To which may be added that moſt evident place, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47.56. where he ſaith plainly that <hi>cruelty and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion toward thoſe whom ſhe had overcome, brought the Lady and Miſtriſs of the world to ſit down in the duſt in perpetual ſilence and darkneſs.</hi> I will refer you but to one place more which treats moſt largely of the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> ruine, &amp; that is <hi>Habakk.</hi> 2. from the fifth verſe to the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> which whoſoever reads
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170332:113"/>muſt caſt his eyes very careleſly upon it, who doth not ſee that <hi>unſatiable co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, cruelty, bloodineſs, violence, ſpoiling and ſuch like ſins,</hi> are made to have a greater hand then their Idols <hi>in reaching the cup of the Lords right hand unto them, and making them ſo drunken and full gorged, that ſhamefull ſpewing was upon all their glory.</hi> And take notice alſo that one reaſon why this miſchief was not prevented, and this deſtruction came upon them while they thought not of it, was the ſame with that which we met withall in the caſe of <hi>Judah.</hi> viz. <hi>The baſe flattering humour of their Sooth-ſayers, the men-pleaſing propheſies of ſuch Diviners and watchmen as they had</hi> (though pittifull ones they were) <hi>who had told them lyes, juſt as the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Gods people had done to them:</hi> which the latter part of that <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47. doth give us reaſon to take for a truth.</p>
               <p n="8">8. How long ſhould I make this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe if I ſhould multiply more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars from <hi>Damaſcus, Gaza, Edom, Ammon</hi> and all the reſt mentioned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the firſt &amp; ſecond chapters of <hi>Amos,</hi> who were all threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:170332:114"/>for their oppreſſion &amp; cruelty to be puniſhed without any mercy? He ſaith there that for 3. yea for 4. tranſgreſſions, <hi>i. e.</hi> for a great many he would reckon with them, but he inſtances only in this one of cruelty, as if this was the principal, and that which excelled all the reſt in provocation. And I will only deſire you to conſider as you read thoſe chapters, whether you can refuſe to aſſent to this as a true obſervation, that one great deſtroying (if not the chiefeſt) ſin of all thoſe Nations, was this piece of unmercifulneſs, <hi>their cruel dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with thoſe whom they had conquered, and got into their power.</hi> I am ſure that <hi>Edoms</hi> four tranſgreſſions are ſo near of kin to this, that we can ſcarce make them any more then four degrees of this one ſin, <hi>viz.</hi> want of kindneſs, compaſſion and mercy to thoſe whom it was natural for him to pitty, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when he had the better of them, <hi>Amos</hi> 1.11. <hi>He did purſue his Brother with the ſword; and did caſt off all pitty, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. ANd now I ſhall deſcend to the fourth and laſt thing which I am engaged to treat of; <hi>That where peace, ſettlement and ſafety is expected by any Nation, they are to have a great care to ſee whether they be guilty of ſuch things as theſe, and if they be, deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be humbled, and ſpeedily to reform.</hi> This commands our regard
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:170332:119"/>with the greater authority, becauſe it hath all the former diſcourſes ſpeaking in its behalf. But nothing ſhould more awaken us to minde it than this conſideration, that many cozened themſelves by a ready performance of ſome religious duties, into a moſt dangerous ſecurity and vain confidence in God, whileſt by reaſon of theſe ſins (which are accounted by ſuch perſons but ſmall petty matters in compare with their gliſtering piety) they have been working their own ruine. And I think no Nation is more concerned in it than this wherein we live, becauſe God hath begun, ſhall I ſay, to ſmite us, and lay us low, or hath almoſt laid our honour in the duſt; to this land therefore I may well uſe the Prophet <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> words, and ſay, as it is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.22. <hi>Now be ye not mockers, leſt your bands be made ſtrong. For I have heard from the Lord God of hosts a conſumption even determined upon the whole earth,</hi> I mean, let us not make light of all Gods admonitions and meſſages that he ſends to us, leſt we be bound with ſuch iron chains of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:170332:120"/>affliction as we ſhall never be able to ſhake off; for I have aſſurance from the Word of God in the mouth of his Prophets, that God will make an utter end, as he hath begun, if we will not put away the evil of our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God indeed doth really deſire the peace and quiet of Nations, and he loves not to afflict them, but when there is great need; which ſhould make us reform more ſpeedily when he chaſtiſes us, becauſe his chaſtiſements are an indication of great diſtempers upon us. He doth not alwayes uſe the ſame courſes to make us good, but he changes his method as he ſees moſt uſeful for us. As the husband-man ſometimes plows and breaks the clods, and again at other ſeaſons ſows his ſeed (according as it follows in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.24, 25.) ſo doth God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cut and break us by afflictions, and ſometimes inſtruct us and teach us by his Word that he ſows among us. And as the Husband-man doth not draw his Cart wheel over the ſmaller grains, as he doth over his Wheat, but
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:170332:120"/>beats the Fitches &amp; Cummin out with a rod or a ſwitch: Even ſo doth God in his husbandry upon mens ſouls; he ſometimes afflicts more gently and lightly, and at other times more ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and heavily, according as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his patients require, <hi>v.</hi> 27. And as the ſame husband-man will not be ever threſhing his Wheat, or breaking it with his wheel, or ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it with his horſes hoof, but only ſo long till he hath ſeparated it from the chaff, <hi>v.</hi> 28. ſo doth God likewiſe afflict and beat us, only ſo long till he hath looſened us from our ſins wherein we were ſettled, as the Corn in the ears, and then he ceaſes. God is wonderful in counſel, and excellent in working, and he oft-times ſhakes Nations very ſorely, but it is that they may repent and be divided from their ſins, as the Wheat by winnowing from the chaff, and then he will ſettle them more firmly again, and lay them up ſafely, as the Wheat is repoſited in the granary after all its knocks and agitations.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But then theſe things which
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:170332:121"/>have exerciſed my pen ſo long, muſt (as I ſaid) be carefully repented of and amended. For <hi>firſt</hi> they were propoſed to this people before their captivity as matters to be reformed, if they hoped for any favour from God; as you may read in <hi>Hoſea,</hi> chap. 10.12. and chap. 12.6. and eſpecially in <hi>Amos</hi> his words to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who had been much waſted and ſpoiled (chap. 4.) from the ſeventh verſe of the fifth chapter, to the ſixteenth, which is again repeated with abundance of earneſtneſs, <hi>ver.</hi> 21, 22, 23, 24. to this ſenſe, <hi>Do not make a noiſe in mine ears with good words and flattering devotions; away with theſe offerings and ſacrifices in which you are ſo forward, but let me ſee judgement and righteouſneſs like a mighty torrent carry all before it.</hi> And to what they ſay relating to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Prophets <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> conſent, when they ſpeak concerning <hi>Judah.</hi> This you may underſtand, if you will be at no more labour, but to caſt your eyes on <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.8, 9, 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.14, 15, 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in which laſt place you
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:170332:121"/>may obſerve, that when the <hi>ſinners in Sion</hi> ſaw the great deſtruction that God had made by the Army of <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib</hi> (of which he had been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before) thoſe <hi>hypocrites</hi> began to be ſurprized with fear, leſt the ſame burning ſhould be made among them, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. Now the Prophet tells them how to avoid it in the following ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſaith ver. 17. that if they did do as he adviſed them, they ſhould ſee <hi>their King</hi> in his beauty, and God would enlarge their territories, and they ſhould be a terrour to all their enemies, and they ſhould ſee no Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians among them any more, but <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> ſhould ſtand for ever, and be like a Land of rivers, yet without any enemy to annoy it, ver. 17, 18, 19, 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo you may read in <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.5, 6, 7. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.2, 3, 4, 5. where he ſaith, that if they would exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute judgement and righteouſneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then <hi>Kings</hi> ſhould ſtill ſit upon the throne of <hi>David.</hi> Which very thing they might have learnt from the experience of their Fathers, ver. 15, 16, 17. concerning one of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:170332:122"/>whom it is there ſaid, <hi>That he judged the cauſe of the poor and needy, and then it was well with him. And was not this to know me ſaith the Lord?</hi> Yes, this is the buſineſs, though you would fain make the world believe that you know God, while you are covetous, unjuſt, unmerciful, bloody, cruel, and would perſwade your ſelves that you are a Religious people, and ſhall be in ſafety; yet there is no ſuch matter; do not deceive your ſelves; It went well with your Fathers then only when they did execute judgement and juſtice, and then they truly had the knowledge of God. Thoſe words indeed are ſpoken of a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (but concerned all the Nation, as I have applyed them) and that was <hi>Joſiah,</hi> a good Prince, whoſe ſon <hi>Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> it ſeems ſtept over his brothers head to the Crown (for he was the youngeſt, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.16.) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is threatned by God to be carried away, and they are bid to weep for him, more then for <hi>Joſiah</hi> who was dead, ver. 10, 11. And then for the next King, who was <hi>Jehojakim,</hi> he
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:170332:122"/>minded only his own greatneſs, and built him a fine houſe by unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, raiſing unreaſonable taxes, or otherwiſe oppreſſing his ſubjects, and defrauding labourers of their wages, <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14, 15. and therefore God threatens him, that he ſhall be buried with the burial of an Aſs, none lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for him, his Nobles not bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with <hi>Ah my Brother,</hi> nor the people or ſtrangers with <hi>Ah Lord,</hi> or <hi>ah his glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. I need not add, that as without theſe things they could not be continued in the <hi>good land</hi> that God gave them; ſo there was no hopes of any long ſettlement after they were returned from Babylons ſlavery, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they did carefully obſerve them: For the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> (in the next chapter to that, at which this diſcourſe began) doth plainly tell them, as hath been already ſaid that they muſt exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute judgement, and ſpeak truth, and not ſo much as harber any evil deviſes and contrivances againſt one another in their hearts, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.16, 17. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe their <hi>Feaſts</hi> and dayes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:170332:123"/>(which came in ſtead of their mournful meetings, <hi>ver.</hi> 18, 19.) would do no more to keep the heavens clear and ſhining upon them, then their <hi>Faſts</hi> and ſorrowful daies could do before, to diſperſe thoſe black clouds that had gathered about them. And therefore when God tells of ſuch joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full times, he adds this <hi>memento</hi> again. That they <hi>ſhould love truth and peace.</hi> As one of the Jews ſaith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Faſt, that <hi>Merces jejunij eſt Eleemoſyna,</hi> the beſt thing in it, and that which crowns it, is an act of mercy; the ſame may we ſay of their Feaſts, which were all of them like the <hi>Athenian</hi>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. IT may now be expected that I ſhould ſearch into the ſtate of this ſinful Nation wherein we live, and conſider whether our caſe do not pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel that which I have now deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. But I being one of the meaneſt of thoſe ſpiritual <hi>Phyſitians</hi> that are in it, and but of ſmall <hi>practice</hi> and little <hi>experience,</hi> do not conceive my ſelf ſufficient to make a full diſcovery of the temper and conſtitution of it.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:170332:125"/>Healthy I am ſure it is not, but deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ſick and like to die, unleſs Gods infinite mercy and our care pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent: But whether it labour of this diſeaſe more then any other, which was the plague of the Jewiſh ſtate, I have not acquaintance enough with particular perſons to affirm. But yet I am not ſo blind, as not to ſee what the actions of ſome men profeſſing Religion have been among us, at whoſe diſeaſe, without coming near them to feel their pulſe, an ordinary skill may more then conjecture. And therefore I cannot but ſuſpect that a great many are ſick of the ſame, though <hi>I</hi> do not know them; and that their zeal and good affection to ſome duties of piety, is but their diſeaſe and not a good habit of their ſouls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This jealouſie made me to take this pains, and to touch this ſore ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſharply in many paſſages of this diſcourſe. And let me intreat thoſe that are of greater skil and larger obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that have had more to do in the world then my years and obſcurity
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:170332:126"/>would permit me, and whoſe books are like to come into more hands; let them I ſay make a more exact inquiry into the ſtate of this nation, and when they have paſſed a judgement upon its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per diſtemper, tell all the people of it as plainly as they can, the danger in which they lie, of being made the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his wrath. For though I dare not take upon me to be as one of the old <hi>Prophets,</hi> and to ſay that the nation is generally guilty of all theſe ſins; yet thus much I have more then ſaid, that as they were the ruine of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> ſo will they bring down Gods vengeance on our heads if they be found to reign among us, unleſs we unfeignedly forſake them. And this I ſhall further ſay, that I very much fear by what I have obſerved of ſome, that if a Prophet ſhould now ariſe among us, or in other parts of the Chriſtian, yea the Reformed world; he would thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der out againſt us the ſame words that I have cited out of the book of God. He would tell us how little difference men make of right and wrong, that they invade one anothers rights and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:170332:126"/>properties, wallow in blood and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet cry up the purity of Religion, the merits of Chriſt Jeſus, and ſuch like things, with as loud a voice as they in the Prophet did <hi>the Temple of the Lord.</hi> And though men talk much of ſeparating themſelves from the <hi>world,</hi> yet it is a great doubt with me whether He would have any better language for thoſe who are double-refined from Popery, and have reformed even the reformation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For ſad it is to think what horrid things have been done among us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the glorious name of Chriſt Jeſus. It is but a ſmall thing to ſay that men have <hi>winnowed with every wind, and gone in every way</hi> (as it is <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.9.) or that they have taken all wayes of getting riches, and become any ones creature to become great; or that they have broken the Laws and Sanctions of the place where they live to make them ſerve their ends, with ſuch like things: For rapine and oppreſſion, cruelty and bloodſhed, falſneſs and perjury, and whatſoever the covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or ambition of men would put
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:170332:127"/>them upon, have been blanched and whited over with the moſt ſpecious and fair names of Religion, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God. And one cannot chuſe but have a fear that this infection hath ſpread far and near in the Nation, ſeeing it hath been almoſt an <hi>honourable</hi> thing to wrong an enemy, and ſeeing men have had ſo many rich and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting occaſions (which they call provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences) to do againſt known Laws &amp; principles of Conſcience. Who can then hold his peace from ſpeaking of theſe things? how can I forbear to wiſh that I had a voice as loud as <hi>Stentor,</hi> or like that of <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Homer,</hi> that I might make theſe things that I have ſaid to ring in the ears of the people of this Land! Though you exalt your ſelves as the Eagle in high flown devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and though you build your neſt in the ſtars, and talk of glorious illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, though you think you dwell in the rock, and ſhall hide your ſelves in Chriſt Jeſus, yet from thence will theſe ſins bring you down, and ſhame ſhall cover you. I have the word of the <hi>righteous Lord</hi> for what I ſay, and I
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:170332:127"/>the teſtimony of all ages, and mine own eyes have ſeen thoſe things done which I verily thought would be the ruine of the Actors of them, and ſo they have proved.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let every man therefore enter into his own heart, and conſider whether there be any violence in his hands when he lifts them up in ſupplications to heaven; any of the blood of the poor and oppreſſed running about his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers when he layes hold of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; any unjuſt acquiſitions that he is conſcious of, when he devotes any thing to his ſervice. If theſe things be not found among us, we may have hopes that God will not make us a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation; but if they be, we ought deeply to be humbled for our hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical faſtings, prayers and humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and for that whileſt we <hi>would needs lean upon God,</hi> and <hi>cry the Temple of the Lord, and called for the building up of</hi> Sion, we have not minded ſo much as matters of common juſtice, equity and mercy between a man and his neighbour.

               <p n="1">1. BUT that this diſcourſe may not be liable to any miſtakes, I ſhall a little farther open the ſenſe of what hath been ſaid, whereby like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it will become more uſefull to the Reader, if he pleaſe to attend it. I do not affirm either of theſe two things; firſt that theſe are the only ſins that undo a Nation; or ſecondly that theſe
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:170332:130"/>were more heinous in themſelves then the Idolatry whereof the Jewiſh Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were alſo guilty. No, let me not be ſo underſtood as if I thought that denying of God, blaſpheming of his name, worſhipping of Idols, and ſuch like ſins as are more immediately againſt the Deity, were not waſting ſins, &amp; more horrid then the other: But the truths that I aſſert are theſe. Firſt, that the ſins of injuſtice, fraud and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty are and have been enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy a Nation without the other; and Secondly, that they commonly prove the moſt dangerous and ruinating to a people of any elſe, becauſe they are overlooked when they reform, though being duties toward our Brother whom we continually ſee, one would think they ſhould be in our eyes above all other. When men reform impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties againſt God, they think themſelves to have done him ſuch high ſervice, and are ſo much in thoſe upper ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, that they take no notice of theſe things under their feet, and make no reckoning how they deal with men, ſo they be but zealous and fierce for
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:170332:130"/>that which is due to God. Or they be content to be religious &amp; given to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, ſo they may but retain their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull gains, pleaſures and ambitious ends; yea their very religion and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs for reformation in ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters may give them a better advantage more colourably to practiſe theſe ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities; and their unmortified affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will eaſily put them in mind to make uſe of ſuch opporunities.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence I ſay it is that theſe ſins do more commonly ruine thoſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that know God, then corruption in his worſhip doth; not becauſe that is not deſtructive, but becauſe men will a great deal ſooner reform in that then in theſe other; for a fair corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with God in all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward duties of his worſhip is a great deal more eaſie then this denyal of mens ſelves in their covetous, maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ambitious, and other fleſhly deſires. And beſide it is more apt to get a man a great name among others, if it be in any good meaſure of fervency and heat, and likewiſe to beget in himſelf a comfortable opinion that he is mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170332:131"/>beloved of God, ſeeing he doth thoſe things that are moſt highly reputed of. So much hypocriſie therefore and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit being in mens hearts, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo willing thus to put a cheat upon themſelves; I hope it will not by any be deemed unſeaſonable that I have treated of this matter, rather then of the other. And if any will be ſo cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious as to ſay that I have not preſſed the matters of religious worſhip ſo much as I ought; they had beſt take heed that they do not bring our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himſelf under their laſh. For when the Ruler asked him (<hi>Luk.</hi> 19.18.) what he ſhould do to inherit eternal life; He doth not ſay one word concerning the duties of the firſt Table, but only of the Second, in which it ſhould ſeem they were more negligent then in the reſt. And when the man anſwered that he had done all thoſe things that he ſpoke of: Our Saviour doth not Catechiſe him how he had kept the Sabbath, and abhorred Idols, and ſuch matters; but he deſires him only to be careful of this one thing further, which was <hi>that he would wholly take his heart
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:170332:131"/>off from covetouſneſs, and the love of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. If any ask how it comes to paſs that men ſhould be ſo very zealous and forward in pious duties when they are ſo cold in the other; I have already given him an anſwer to this purpoſe. <hi>Firſt</hi> the religious ſervices in their greateſt outward purity do not find the nature of man ſo averſe unto and abhorrent from them, but that they may be very forward to do them. And <hi>(Secondly)</hi> They make alſo a great ſound and dinn in the world, and have ſuch a glorious appearance, that by the doing of them he may be reputed, and alſo take himſelf for a <hi>Saint.</hi> And <hi>(Thirdly)</hi> Then he may be ſo pleaſed with this fine perſwaſion, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly tickled with the ſweetneſs of ſuch thoughts, that he is engaged to mind with all his power the promoting of ſuch matters as have gained him the credit of an holy perſon, without denying his worldly luſts; which may rather have a freer liberty under ſuch a brave and ſplendid Maſter as ſtands not upon <hi>Punctilio</hi>'s of honeſty and
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:170332:132"/>equity between one man and another. But <hi>(Fourthly)</hi> if we turn our eyes the other way, we ſhall find that <hi>juſtice and mercy, pitty and compaſsion, forgiveneſs and doing good to others</hi> (eſpecially to thoſe who have wronged us) will fall out ſometimes with a mans worldly intereſt and carnal deſires, and will put him to learn that hard leſſon of ſelf-denyall; and beſides, they make no ſuch great noiſe in the world, but muſt be content to paſs with many men for a piece of <hi>dull morality.</hi> It was moſt truly ſaid by a wiſe and a great Maſter,<note place="margin">Ren. Des Cartes.</note> 
                  <hi>Nulli facilius ad magnam pietatis famam perveniunt, quam ſuperſtitioſi &amp; hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critae.</hi> None ſooner obtain a great fame for piety, then ſuperſtitious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and hypocrites. One reaſon I conceive of it may be, that men who have nothing elſe to ſhew for their ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity but their religious performances, will be moſt nice, exact, and even ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious about them; and do them with a greater pang of zeal then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cordial Chriſtians. And this ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily obtains for them the name of holy and devout perſons among men; when
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:170332:132"/>honeſty, mercy, and a ſober religion and piety cannot prevail for ſo much credit, becauſe they make not ſuch a buzzle in the world.</p>
               <p>Now you all know how ready men are to ſtickle for that which draws the eyes of all men to it, and if you do not, the Apoſtle will tell you how ſoon this diſeaſe began in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church. For that which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> reproves in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> was this, that they made moſt ſtir about that which brought them the greateſt glory and moſt credit; <hi>preferring gifts of tongues before prophecy; and prophecy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore love and charity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. And beſides you muſt conſider further how fair an occaſion men have to be diſhoneſt when others rely ſo much upon their credit, that they will thank them even when they deceive them; and think they have uſed them very kindly (becauſe they ſay ſo) when they have dealt very hardly with them. This makes many dreſs themſelves up religiouſly, becauſe it is a more cleanly way of catching the prey, when the Wolf puts on the Sheeps skin. He
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:170332:133"/>may devour a ſilly Lamb in a corner, and wipe his mouth, and none can ſay that he hath done any harm. The well minded people flock very innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſimply to a man who is famed for piety; and now if he be a beaſt of prey, there is no ſuch opportunity as this to devour and raven, becauſe he is taken for one of the ſheep of Chriſt. And therefore it was anciently obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that no man could ſo ſecurely commit all wicked actions as he who had gained the repute of an honeſt man.

                  </note> Religion (as a learned man of our own ſpeaks) is but a politique Engine of State in ſome mens hands; but of ſuch power, that it is uſefull for the battery as well as the defence of the State; and as ſerviceable to the ruine as the conſervation of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. A very neceſſary thing it is as they handle it to the turning of affairs here below, but of no concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all to the other world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And of theſe that put on a face of Religion out of deſign, there are <hi>three</hi> ſorts which I will unmask before you. The firſt is he that <hi>deſigns his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and utility,</hi> when he ſees that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is a fair means whereby he may riſe to Greatneſs, a ladder whereby he may climb to high preferments. When he diſcerns the times are of that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that Religion will make a good mask to hide his covetous, ambitious and perfidious intendments from the eyes of well meaning and charitable men; when he perceives that it will make him to be more truſted, and that a greater confidence ſhall thereby be repoſed in him; there is no man ſhall
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:170332:139"/>have a more Saint-like garb, a more reformed tongue, and devout behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. Many petty chapmen in the world that trade but for little things, have learnt this Art, to gain credit and repute with others that ſo they may ſuffer themſelves to be cheated by them with more faith and confidence. We may be ſure then that the Great ones of the world, who deſign higher matters, and aim at more lofty ends, are well verſed in theſe religious tricks of deceiving. <hi>Herod</hi> pretended religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous devotion and worſhip which he would fain give to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that this <hi>Lamb of God</hi> ſhould be the ſacrifice. <hi>Numa</hi> among the Ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> pretended Revelations and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with a Goddeſs, but it was to make himſelf a God among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and his Laws held for ſacred. And ſo the Grand impoſter <hi>Mahomet</hi> (as is in every ones mouth) held his neck away, as if he lookt for a whiſper from heaven, when his head hung towards the world, and he meant only to get his doctrine to be more devoutly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by the people. The Maſters
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:170332:139"/>of policy know that their talk of God, their praying to him, and their ſolemn attendance on all religious offices, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a ſanctimonious carriage &amp; ſeeming ſqueamiſhneſs of Conſcience, will make them more reverenced by the multitude, &amp; leſs ſuſpected to have any but good and ſimple deſigns. They know that theſe things will make the world gape upon them, and ſwallow all their propoſals without any chewing; or elſe they willmake them caſt all the <hi>odium</hi> of their wicked actions upon other men, and hold them excuſed as men whoſe integrity would not ſuffer them to do ſo badly: or at the worſt paſs them by for religious weakneſſes and infirmities, unto which all are incident. It is not to be told what the name of a <hi>Saint</hi> will do to hallow thoſe actions which in other men would ſeem as black as the <hi>Devil;</hi> to caſt a varniſh and a moſt handſome gloſs upon the moſt helliſh and fouleſt enterprizes. And therefore the Politician had been much defective if he had left this Rule out from among the reſt, <hi>That a man who would be great in the world, muſt be
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:170332:140"/>externally religious.</hi> And the greater grace and comelineſs he is able to act Religion withall, the more eyes he ſhall have upon him, and the more will fall down and worſhip him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A <hi>Second</hi> ſort there is that deſign their own eaſe, pleaſure and bruitiſh delights, whom I may call the <hi>Fleſhly Politians.</hi> Men that are cunning in this art of Religion, that thereby they may enjoy the foul delights of the fleſh with more ſecurity, and with the favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable opinion of the multitude. By a great ſhew of ſomething that is extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary in devotion, they hope to draw the eyes of the world from their beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, and make them gaze at the <hi>ſtrange appearances</hi> that they ſay is of God in them. They hope by making a <hi>blaze on high,</hi> to make men take no notice of what is done here <hi>below,</hi> juſt as they ſee while the vulgar ſtare at ſome comets that appear in the heavens, they neglect what is under their feet more apparent upon the earth. And therefore they reſolve to talk of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull <hi>manifeſtations, diſcoveries</hi> and <hi>appearances of God</hi> to them, they riſe
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:170332:140"/>preſently into the clouds in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and diſcourſe of divine things in a myſtical ſtrain; they ſpeak of <hi>revelations</hi> and <hi>high illuminations</hi> from heaven, and uſe perhaps ſome very <hi>fiery devotions</hi> which dazzle the vulgars eyes and amaze their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ſo that they cannot ſee their wicked and abominable pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices. But if men will needs be prying into their ſecrets, and when they ſee them, will not in charity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe men of ſuch high attainments, then they begin to <hi>rant</hi> more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and boldly to affirm that all things are lawfull to men of ſuch a growth, and in ſuch ſpecial favour with God, and lead ſo certainly by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Or if they do not go thus high, yet they take up the Religion that is in faſhion, on purpoſe that they may avoid all ſufferings and perſecution, and that they may never receive any moleſtation in their beloved fleſh. They are reſolved to do any thing that they may never feel any <hi>pain,</hi> and if Religion be the way to preſerve them from it, they will make it their <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:170332:141"/>ſure</hi> to counterfeit it as exactly as they can. Such are the <hi>Leviathans</hi> of this Age, who love to tumble up and down in the flood of worldly delights, and would rather imitate all Religions then be of any. The <hi>great pillar of their Religion is ſelf-preſervation,</hi> though our Saviour hath expreſly ſaid. <hi>That he who will ſave his life ſhall loſe it, and he who will loſe it ſhall find it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. A <hi>third</hi> ſort may have it in their deſign to ſpread ſome dangerous no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and traiterous opinions againſt <hi>God,</hi> for the hiding of which it is but neceſſary that they ſeem very ſtrictly pious. All men are very ſhy of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Atheiſt, or of one that denyes the Bible to be Gods word; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they that would diſſeminate any thing to the prejudice of that belief we have of a Deity and of the holy Scriptures; muſt look as if they were of all men the furtheſt off from ſuch prophaneneſs. And though they laugh in corners at the ridiculous ſimplicity (as they deem it) of thoſe that fear before God and tremble at his word; yet before others they can put on a
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:170332:141"/>ſowre face, and ſeem to do more then ſtand in awe of him. But theſe <hi>Players</hi> and <hi>Actors</hi> in Religion it is not my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to ſet forth in all their colours, both becauſe they are not ſo numerous as the other, and becauſe they cannot ſtand long upon the ſtage before they go off &amp; every one know what they are.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>Pharaſaical Hypocriſie</hi> is a more fine and ſubtile poiſon, whereby a man <hi>Coſens himſelf</hi> and puts a cheat upon his own ſoul; and therefore about the diſcovery of it I ſhall beſtow all my pains, as moſt latent, and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in greateſt need of a cure. This is it alſo which the Scripture ſpeaks of, in whoſe phraſe <hi>hypocriſie, flattering of God, and lying to him with ones lips</hi> do not ſignifie the profeſſing of one thing and meaning another, but a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent profeſsion of love to God and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, without a cordial renouncing of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that is contrary to him and it:</hi> or a great heat and forwardneſs to ſome things that God commands which are eaſie and more ſuitable to a mans guſt and humor, with a coldneſs to other things that are more difficult and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:170332:142"/>to his nature and intereſt. There is an <hi>extraordinary meaſure of Zeal</hi> for ſome matters required to its conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, elſe they in whom it is would not be ſo confident as they are that they are good Chriſtians; but then this <hi>zeal</hi> is not equally deſtributed through the whole man, and doth not animate and quicken him to all his duty; and that is it which makes it to be <hi>Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,</hi> and not true Religion. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if a man have this <hi>partial zeal</hi> in hearing of Gods word and diligent attending upon Sermons, this may make him take himſelf for a Saint; whereas his frozenneſs to meditation and ſecret converſe with God, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent examination of all his actions, renders him a meer hypocrite. So if he be partially zealous for the purging of himſelf from ſuperſtitious conceits and Popiſh tenents, but yet remain a Mammoniſt, a <hi>Lucifer,</hi> a murtherer of his Brethren by hatred and uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cenſuring of others that differ from him; this is the ſame diſeaſe, though he take himſelf for a man excellently pious. And on the contrary, if a man
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:170332:142"/>be juſt in his dealing, and carefull not to cheat, but yet be all bedaubed with the world, and laden with thick clay, &amp; ſtick faſt in covetouſneſs, or neglect many religious duties to Godward, he is but an <hi>hypocritical Religioniſt,</hi> though he keep his Church, and pay the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter his dues as well as others.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And if you ſhould ask me why this good conceit that men have of their Piety may not be eaſily beaten down, when it is ſo viſible that they live in great ſins, and have not denyed abundance of their earthly affections: I anſwer, that their firſt reſolutions to undertake ſome duties of Religion are commonly very warm, if not hot and fiery, which inſpires them preſently with a perſwaſion that they are dearly beloved of God, becauſe they feel ſuch a difference in themſelves from what they were before in their total coldneſs. Now though they continue to live in many ſins, yet this perſwaſion doth not abate, (1.) Becauſe this zeal doth continue and hold on afterwards through the concurrence of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Temper with it, which inclines
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:170332:143"/>them to that ſort of actions, or doth not make them averſe from them. And (2) Then they may think it to be a Temptation of the Devil, to doubt of their good eſtate after they have had ſuch great aſſurance (as they imagine) from God. And (3) They find a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to do thoſe things that they do not, which they take to be a great ſign of grace: Eſpecially ſeeing (4) That they are troubled for the not doing of them, and they have now and then ſome ſad thoughts about it. Yea (5) Their Conſcience perhaps is much againſt it when they do it, and they commit ſuch ſins not without great reluctance and difficulty: Which indeed renders their condition the worſe becauſe they can ſin even againſt conſcience; but they take it to be a ſign of <hi>their</hi> tenderneſs, not of their ſins ſtrength. And (6) Perhaps they have learnt to call ſuch ſins their <hi>Infirmities,</hi> and hearing that all have their failings, theſe they think are theirs. And (7) By their Confeſſions and Prayers, and outward humiliations, they hope to gain pardon for all: or (8) Perhaps
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:170332:143"/>they think there is no need: but by a device beyond all theſe, they imagine Jeſus Chriſt hath done all for them long ago. And ſo the leſs they do, the more they ſhall be beholden to him, and the more honour they do him by putting more upon his account then others dare do, who will be doing more themſelves.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Thus I ſay do they ratifie that <hi>Decree,</hi> which they have paſſed for themſelves in heaven: They having ſo certainly <hi>fore-ordained</hi> that they ſhall inherit eternal joyes, none of thoſe foul blemiſhes that are in their actions can blot out their names which they have written in the Book of life. But though they think that nothing can hinder their admiſſion to that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed place which they have deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for themſelves: yet God I am ſure hath choſen no ſuch perſons to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If the holy Apoſtle be not leſs infallible then they, you had better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.13.</note> when he ſaith <hi>that God hath choſen us to ſalvation, through ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Spirit and belief of the truth;</hi> and when he prayes <hi>that the whole Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>

                  <hi>Soul and Body may be preſerved blameleſs unto the coming of our Lord Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe men may mount up while they are in ſome holy exerciſe as high as the third heavens, and think verily that they are in Gods embraces; But they will find ſhortly that all their hopes will fall to the ground, as that Turk did from the top of the <hi>Moſque,</hi> who perſwaded the people that he could fly. And therefore let us be ſure to lay the foundations of a ſolid and entire Religion in our ſouls, and take heed we do not deceive our ſelves with ſome flaſhy devotions, and a lame, halting obedience. To mortifie all our carnal affections, to put off the body of ſin, is the work of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and becauſe of the multitude of our enemies, and the infirmities of our fleſh, we ſhall find it a matter hard and difficult. How inſuperable then will this work be, if our Religion it ſelf do conſpire with the Fleſh, and if that which ſhould ſerve for the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſin, do by a great many falſe Principles exceedingly promote it?
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:170332:144"/>That it may not do ſo, but that our Religion may be in us a <hi>Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> I ſhall now proceed to ſhew you what the counterfeits of it are, and how ſmall a matter, if we be not ſerious, will tickle us with a belief that we are good Chriſtians, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a total change of our hearts and lives.</p>

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:170332:146"/>themſelves, taking upon them to be the moſt <hi>pure and refined</hi> of all other, whileſt they lived in a ſenſual manner. And ſome of the Jews it ſeems were of this party, who though they were like other of the people of <hi>Crete,</hi> lying, lazy and gutling ſots,<note place="margin">Crete.</note> (<hi>ver.</hi> 11.) yet they gave out that they above all others were acquainted with God, and had his ſecrets committed to them. Yea, ſo zealous they were, that they made a conſiderable party in the world, and by their clamour and noiſe decrying all others, they made many weak Chriſtians doubt whether they were not in the right way and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the beſt religion. For they were a very confident ſort of men, and thoſe that looked with a kind of diſdain and ſcorn upon the reſt of the world; ſo that the humble and meek ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt, leſt they ſhould be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braved by impudence and taken for a company of ſilly ſneaks, were fain to rebuke them ſharply, (<hi>ver.</hi> 13.) and to uſe ſome ſeverity toward them. You may ſee this more plainly, if you read but <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.17, 18, 19, 20. where
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:170332:146"/>the Apoſtle tels us what the boaſts and braggs of the Jews were concerning their knowledge, and how they lookt upon all others as children and fools that muſt be taught by them.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="3">3. Such a <hi>Wordy religion</hi> there is ſtill
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:170332:147"/>in the world, and it makes the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>noiſe</hi> of all others, becauſe it is a <hi>Sound.</hi> The men who <hi>profeſs</hi> it hold no gift greater then that of <hi>talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and they had need be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that they are not dumb; for if they were, there would appear no more of Religion in them then in an old Statue of ſome antient Saint.

It is ordinary to hear men talk ſo long of the <hi>beauty,</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> &amp; <hi>ſweetneſs,</hi> and <hi>preciouſneſs</hi> of Chriſt, that they beget in themſelves as well as their hearers a perſwaſion that they are mightily in love with him.

If they ſpeak of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they paint him in <hi>Solomons</hi> language <hi>White and ruddy, the chiefeſt among ten thouſands, with a head of fine gold,</hi>

                  <hi>and covered with purple, and ſuſtained with pillars of ſilver for the daughters of</hi> Jeruſalem. Who would not be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed that hears of all theſe delicate fine things? what heart can chuſe but be taken with all this beauty and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very? And how can we think that it is not enough to tranſport the man himſelf into heaven, to ſee others ſo moved and drawn by him? And yet all the while this goodly do is made, the man may not know himſelf what
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:170332:148"/>he means by all theſe expreſſions. They make a fine noiſe, and run ſmoothly off the tongue, but they are little better, as they handle the matter, then non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant expreſſions to themſelves and others. I ſhall not now add how many new words are minted and huddled together to ſupply the want of ſolid matter: Nor how many mens tongues are tipt with good words which they have heard from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of others: but ſhall only ſay this, that theſe men talk of God either in ſuch words as have no fulneſs of ſenſe in them, but are devoid and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all true life, or elſe in ſuch words whoſe ſenſe and life they have no feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of in their ſouls.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And yet I have told you of the beſt that can be found of this ſort of religion. There are others that mind not ſo much this fluency and abundant language, but their greateſt care is to ſpeak ſo, that they may not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, but admired by the rabble as great <hi>Sophi's,</hi> and men of a more then ordinary elevation. I wiſh this had been the religion only of ſome in the

                  </gap>, that were ſcattered here and there, and made up a body of nonſenſe out of them. Alas! this is one of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes of our Age alſo, wherein many men have affected unintelligible lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and believed they were Eagles that were courted to look upon the Sun, becauſe they could ſoar aloft into a cloud of words. When they had taken abundance of Prophetical expreſſions, and careleſly jumbled them into a confuſion, they ſeemed to themſelves like men inſpired and that ſpoke oracles, when they did but ſlaver out their own tranſcendent non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And if theſe men can but arrive to the confidence of prating ſaucily to their betters, this is reputed a ſingular gift, and they take themſelves to be indued with an extraordinary meaſure of zeal for God and his cauſe. But if they can perk. up into the Pulpit, and
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:170332:149"/>take the boldneſs to be Preachers and Inſtructers to others; this is an <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mark,</hi> and now they cannot doubt but they are full of the Spirit of God. This is the thing that tickles them more then all the reſt; and their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, the <hi>Scribes and Phariſees</hi> never loved more to ſit in <hi>Moſes</hi> his chair, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 23.2.) then their fingers itch to be laying the Law before the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But let ſuch men who delight to hear themſelves talk, conſider (if they have not loſt that Faculty whereby we are men) that there may be twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty times more Religion in humble lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, then in this bold teaching of others; and that there is a thouſand times more in hearty doing of what men learn. To that let them bend their ſtudies, and obſerve how greedy they are of riches, how they ſcramble for high places, how worthy they think themſelves of what others en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, how they love to rule and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over them, how impatient they are of contradiction, how ambitious to be thought ſome body in the world,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:170332:149"/>how cenſorious of their neighbours; how fiery &amp; hot againſt diſſenters, how fierce and violent for their Opinion more then for Godlineſs: And then if they believe the Scriptures, let them judge whether the leaven of Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie have not ſowred them. And let us all remember, <hi>That true Religion is a transforming ſenſe of God;</hi> that which changes and alters the temper of mens ſouls; that which ſeaſons and leavens the whole man with Goodneſs: It is not a new Tongue, but a new nature: It conſiſts not in reformed language, but in a reformed life; Not in talking concerning God, but in an imitation of him, and being conformed to him. And then a well-ſeaſoned Heart will make all the words ſavoury and without <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation,</hi> though with good <hi>affection.</hi>

And for this very cauſe it was that they
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:170332:151"/>killed our Saviour, becauſe they thought he contradicted this grand Teacher of their Religion, and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned they did God high ſervice in ſo doing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And yet if you make a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſearch into the buſineſs, you ſhall find that they loved <hi>Moſes</hi> no otherwiſe then as vulgar people love Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> as a brave man, and one who did great things for that Nation, and in whoſe dayes there was a good world. If <hi>Moſes</hi> had lived in our <hi>Saviours</hi> time, and told them of their ſins as he did; they would have loved <hi>Moſes</hi> no more then thieves and traitors loved the Queen, who would not let them ſteal or betray their country. If <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſhould have riſen from the dead, and told them that he allowed divorces only becauſe of the hardneſs of their hearts; they would have given him a bill of divorce, though ſo much wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to him.

               <p n="3">3. Even ſo it is now with many in the Chriſtian world. The name of <hi>Jeſus</hi> is ſo dear unto them, that they have it in their mouths as much as the Jews had the name of <hi>Moſes.</hi> It is ſo full of honey and ſweetneſs, and they are ſo fond of it, that it is on their tongues end before the name of <hi>God</hi> himſelf. This name makes up one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their prayers, and fills up all the gaps and breaches that are in their diſcourſes: And if there be any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of love and court-ſhip wherewith to careſs him, he ſhall not want them. They commend him for the primeſt beauty; extol his pedegree; admire the riches of grace; and if one could tell how to believe them, they would willingly dye for the love of their beloved <hi>Jeſus.</hi> No Sermon pleaſes them that extolls not him; all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes are unprofitable in which his name is not often repeated, and the very ſound of it doth them more good then many wiſe ſentences.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But you muſt not think for all this that they are ſuch vowed ſervants of his as they ſeem. For they love him
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:170332:152"/>only as a Beggar doth his good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or as a ſouldier doth <hi>Alexander, Caeſar,</hi> or ſome ſuch famous Captains, of whoſe great worth and valour he hath heard. As the <hi>Spartans</hi> honoured <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus,</hi> and the <hi>Romans Romulus,</hi> and all Countreys and Cities love thoſe that have been their founders, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curers of great immunities and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits unto them; ſo do theſe perſons love the Lord Jeſus. They look upon him as a <hi>noble Heroe,</hi> a brave man that hath done great wonders, and deſerved highly of man kind: and Eſpecially they are affected toward him as one that is gone to make room for them in a goodly Paradiſe, &amp; will there entertain them with all dainty delights. Which is no more but what may proceed from education and breeding, from Pulpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcourſes and good books, from a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of thoſe joyes that he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, which are enough to make a ſenſual man love him as well as a Turk doth <hi>Mahomet:</hi> Eſpecially conſidering that ſome diſpoſitions are amorous, and others are apt to admire gallant acts and great exploits; and others are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:170332:153"/>taken with the kindneſſes that are done them, and the honours that are put upon them. If they ſhould have lived in our Saviours days, and he ſhould have told them, <hi>Not every one that ſaith Lord Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father;</hi> they would have ſaid as the Phariſees in another caſe, <hi>Are we blind alſo? do not we know who ſhall go to heaven?</hi> If he had ſaid, <hi>You are of your Father the Devil,</hi> for his works you do; they would have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered as the Jews did ſometimes: <hi>Thou art a Samaritan, and haſt a Devil.</hi> If he had told them that he had no bleſſings but for the humble, the meek, the mercifull, the peace-makers, and thoſe that took up their croſs patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (of which number they were not,) they would have joyned with the high Prieſts to bring him to his execution.</p>
               <p n="5">5. What though they condemn the <hi>Phariſees</hi> for killing of our Saviour? It is no more then thoſe men ſaid of their forefathers that murdered the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. And they are as full of hatred, malice and black zeal againſt Chriſts
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:170332:153"/>moſt faithfull Servants, as the Scribes and Phariſees were againſt Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. They verily think that they have a love to <hi>Chriſt</hi> above all the world: but did not the Jews dream of as great an affection to <hi>Moſes?</hi> Either they do not love the world therefore, and their own luſts and deſires better then Chriſts words: or they are no better then thoſe Jews were who loved no more but the <hi>name</hi> of their Maſter <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They have a great zeal for the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> of the Lord Jeſus: but who knows not that the perſons whom they judge as hypocrites, were very fierce for the Ceremonial Law, and loved to be at the Temple? We muſt ſee therefore a great care, diligence and curioſity uſed in all obedience, or elſe we cannot afford them any better lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, notwithſtanding all their flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring addreſſes to our Saviour. And you muſt conſider what a vaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is between the opinion men are apt to have of thoſe who are dead, and of thoſe that are like them, but alive.

And thoſe that they never ſaw, but hear of their excellent deeds, they have in greater admiration then thoſe that are before their eyes. And thoſe very perſons that they could not affect if they were with them, they commend at a diſtance, as they hear them commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by others. For they commonly hear of nothing but what pleaſes them when they are afar off: but they would ſee many actions, and hear many ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, if they converſed with them, that they could not brook. And juſt ſo it is in this caſe: our Saviour is dead, and he likewiſe died as they hear for them: and therefore they cannot but have many good words for him. He is one that they never ſaw, and ſo they admire him for the good they are told of him: while they deſpiſe his live ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and thoſe that are like him. They read of his actions and his words at a diſtance; but they are not ſpoken from his mouth to their particular perſons: and therefore they are not ſo offended at him as they would have been, if they

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:170332:155"/>which their aſpiring minds agitated them withall. And <hi>Epiphanius</hi> applies the place to the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> whoſe fables and dotages the Apoſtle (he ſaith) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, which were more like the talk of a man in a dream, then well awake.</p>
               <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">Cap. 17. n. 7.</note> And it is likely that both the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> dreamers have faln into this ſpiritual phrenſie by that ſame heat which I before ſpoke of, whereby they perſwaded themſelves too early that they were <hi>Saints;</hi> When this meets with a melancholy temper and a ſelfiſh diſpoſition, it is no hard matter to beget in them an opinion of near converſe with God or Angels. For when that fierce humour works and boils up, all experience tells us that it puts men into high and big conceits, if they be of a proud nature: And then their religious inclinations and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons determine the workings of this melancholy fancy to matters concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God, and his Son, and Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Theſe motions they may take to be from a divine power, becauſe they are ſo great, and becauſe they are
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:170332:156"/>ſo much different from what they feel when in their ordinary temper. And this ſelf-love may make them conceit likewiſe that none are like to receive from God ſuch inſpirations ſooner then themſelves; who have ſuch a love to him, and preſuppoſe that they are ſo much in his affections. Now I hope there are not many at this time of this conplexion in Religion; but when there are, you have two remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able characters given of them by Saint <hi>Jude</hi> in that verſe; <hi>They are given to the groſſeſt ſenſualities, and are likewiſe turbulent and ſeditious perſons.</hi> By which they make it plainly appear, that Chriſt is not in them, who was holy, meek and peaceable, and makes all thoſe to be ſo on whom his Spirit breaths.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But there are others of a lower form, who confidently talk of the mind of God likewiſe made known to them, and are altogether buſied in their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies about the glorious times that are enſuing. The <hi>Jews</hi> do not more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect their <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> and think to be made great men by him, then theſe wait to ſee Chriſt come to reign, or at
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:170332:156"/>leaſt themſelves advanced to ſit upon thrones to govern the Nations. They take themſelves to be the candles that are to enlighten all the darker places of Holy Writ. They are as familiarly acquainted with <hi>Daniel,</hi> as others are with the <hi>Proverbs</hi> of <hi>Solomon.</hi> They underſtand St. <hi>Johns Revelation</hi> as well as they do his <hi>three Epiſtles.</hi> And I ſhall not much disbelieve them in this particular; for their Religion hath nothing to do with that love and ſweetneſs, that charity and humility which he commends. While they fancy themſelves <hi>Kings</hi> with Chriſt, they neglect his government in their ſouls, which ſhould keep under all their head-ſtrong paſſions, quell their rebellious affections, tame their wild natures, and reſtrain their brutiſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, which would indeed make <hi>that new world</hi> of things which all good Chriſtians pray for. They conceit a gorgeous pompous ſcene of things, a ſecular and worldly greatneſs, an overflowing tide of proſperous events, while they neglect that poverty of ſpirit, that lowlineſs of mind, that
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:170332:157"/>meekneſs, patience, long-ſuffering, and ſuch like <hi>Royal</hi> graces as make Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans conquerours over the world, and victors of all their enemies. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are to be accounted among thoſe whoſe religion is only words, and great brags ariſing from an high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of favour with God; <hi>who loves thoſe that will be guided by his will, and ruled by his Laws; better then thoſe that would fain fulfill prophecies, and pour out ſome of his vials upon the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. This religion is indeed <hi>Filia vocis</hi> (as the Jews called their laſt kind of Revelation) <hi>the daughter of a voice;</hi> yet not of Gods, but of their own. They thunder and rattle in the world, as if they would bring the heavens about our ears, and pour down the clouds upon us; but it is a tempeſt of their own raiſing, and a ſtorm which their bluſtering paſſions and boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous affections make in themſelves. No whiſper, nor thunder neither, from heaven, nakes men irreligious, proud, contemptuous, diſobedient, bitter, cruel and full of black zeal. Theſe are the breathings of the evil ſpirit, the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:170332:157"/>belches of the bottomleſs pit. Theſe inſpirations ſmell of Sulphur, they ſtink of fire and brimſtome. The true Religion leads a man to a ſolicitous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after that which God hath revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for the reforming of himſelf, and erecting the Government of Chriſt in his ſoul: And the ruling over himſelf, keeping dominion over his luſts, is more deſirable to him, then reigning in pomp and ſtate a thouſand years up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth. The power of Religion makes a man to know <hi>the certainty of thoſe words of truth</hi> which lead him to the life of God but never makes men talk like infallible Prophets, what ſcene of things muſt next take its turn, and what piece of the <hi>Revelation</hi> muſt next come upon the ſtage. All theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to expounding Revelations, and Propheſies, and Secrets of Providence may be but a fancy, and the licouriſh deſire that is in men to be medling with them, may be but ſuch a thing as <hi>Eves</hi> appetite to the Tree, <hi>viz</hi> the fruit of Pride and curioſity. But the Doctrine of Chriſt, is plain full and certain; and the deſire in a mans ſoul
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:170332:158"/>after the knowledge of it, and being acquainted with it, muſt be the fruit of the good ſpirit of God, which leads a man to the life and power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, giving him a great command over himſelf, and all worldly affections, making him to be good, not in word and notion, but in deed and truth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But it is time to leave this ſort of men who are meer talkers of God, and who only give him their good word (as we ordinarily ſpeak) commend him, and ſpeak well of him, but care not to be ſo well acquainted with him, as to be made like him: who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement with him and ſpeak him fair to his face, who pretend to friendſhip with him, and to be of his ſecrets, and will be as near him as he pleaſeth, ſo be it that he will do them no good, nor make any alteration in their ſouls. Let me only annex to this, another <hi>Falſe Religion</hi> very near of kin to it, which conſiſts in <hi>a great out-cry againſt Antichriſt and all his adherents.</hi> This word <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is of that nature, that it may be preſt to ſerve any deſign, and it is become ſuch a <hi>Mormo</hi> to vulgar
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:170332:158"/>people, that their hairs ſtand up an end, and they run away from the face of it as if they were out of their little wits. The more too blame they, who upon every occaſion fright them with it, as unadviſed people do their children with bugbears; which makes them of ſuch a timerous nature, that they fear all things which they never ſaw before, though never ſo good and neceſſary for them. But in the ordinary ſenſe of the word, people underſtand by it the <hi>Pope of Rome,</hi> and imagine they are the friends of Chriſt, becauſe they hate his enemies; and that they are good Proteſtants, becauſe they are againſt the Papal incroachments. But many are beholden to their education for the <hi>planting</hi> this enmity in them, and it is too apt to degenerate into a poiſonous &amp; venemous <hi>Weed</hi> of rancour and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty againſt the perſons of thoſe whoſe vices only we ſhould hate. And others are taught by <hi>invective Sermons</hi> againſt Antichriſt which they happen to hear, to bear a great ſpleen againſt him, though they know not who he is: The natural ſeeds of piety which are in us
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:170332:159"/>towards a Deity, growing into this or that ſhape according to the ſoil in which they are, the natural temper which men are of: and according to the manuring and husbandry that is uſed about them, the diſcourſes which they ordinarily hear for the cheriſhing of piety.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And though all men of this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit think they hate <hi>Antichriſt</hi> as they do the Devil, and therefore judge themſelves good Chriſtians; yet if you look narrowly into them, you ſhall find that they have the very character of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> upon them, and the <hi>mark of the Beaſt</hi> in their forehead, whereby we may know how far they are from true Religion. For if you look into 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. you ſhall find that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> did not conſiſt ſo much in Ignorance, or meerly in holding this or that Speculative Opinion, as in Wickedneſs, Pride, Self-exaltation and Tyrannie. He that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks of, is called <hi>the man of ſin,</hi> v. 3. <hi>the wicked one,</hi> v. 6. he that hath the <hi>myſterie of iniquity,</hi> v. 7. and <hi>comes with all deceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs, i. e.</hi>
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:170332:159"/>with all fine devices to allure men to a fleſhly life, <hi>ver.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>Let it be conſidered therefore how they brand themſelves with the name of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> who fiercely declaim againſt him, but live in <hi>ſin,</hi> do <hi>unjuſtly,</hi> exalt themſelves <hi>above all that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Gods</hi> in this world, love to <hi>domineer</hi> over others, are full of <hi>hatred</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> of their betters; and in ſhort, let them remember that it is no ſmall note of him, that they count all <hi>Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> but themſelves. I ſhall conclude this with thoſe words of the beloved Apoſtle who wrote againſt ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited people as juſtified themſelves, though unrighteous, and condemned all others that were good. <hi>Little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Let no man deceive you; he that doth righteouſneſs, is righteous, even as he is righteous. In this the children of God are manifeſt, and the children of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: Whoſoever doth not righteouſneſs, is not of God, neither he that loveth not his Brother,</hi> 1 John 3.7, 10.</p>

And ſo many wayes alſo they had of diſanulling all Gods commands, as if by their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers they had obtained a power from God to wipe and croſs what they pleaſed out of his Law. They took God to be ſo much beholden to them for their pains and ſweat in praying to him, that they thought he was bound to let them make themſelves an amends ſome other wayes. And becauſe it coſt them much to be ſo devout, they thought their labour was as pretious with him, and that he put the ſame va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue upon it. In ſhort, ſo little there
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:170332:162"/>was in all this devotion, that if a man had had a mind to deny himſelf in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing, his beſt way had been to have put himſelf into the garb of a Phariſee, and buy a grant of God to do what he liſt by many prayers. Which was juſt as if a man ſhould think by giving his neighbour many good morrows, to make him overlook the breaking of his hedges, and the ſtealing of his goods; or as if a man ſhould beſeech another not to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with him, though he beat his children, and took upon him to do what he liſted in his houſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And ſuch there have been in the Chriſtian world, who have delighted in praying and offering up continual petitions to heaven, whom the earth could not bear, becauſe of their vile and wicked lives. As <hi>John Baſilides</hi> Duke of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> whom Dr. <hi>Caſaubon</hi> inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in, who loved to be continually upon his knees and lifting up his hands to God when they were not employed in ſome butcherous and bloody action or other. And <hi>Hacket</hi> here in <hi>England</hi> in the dayes of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> of
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:170332:163"/>whom <hi>Saravia</hi> ſaith that he ſeemed to have a divine heat in him when he prayed, though it is known to all the world with what wild fires he was acted. For there is a <hi>natural ardor</hi> may do much this way (as that Doctor ſpeaks) or rather a <hi>Religious melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>More</hi> hath ſhewn in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Treatiſe of <hi>Enthuſiaſm.</hi> For that humour will work and boil up even to an Exſtaſie, and where it meets with ſome ſpice of Religion, it may do ſtrange feats by way of devotion. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> the Jeſuites tell us, was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lifted up four cubits above the ground when he was at prayer; and he might poſſibly ſeem to himſelf ſo to be, if that be true which <hi>Eunapius</hi> reports of <hi>Jamblicus,</hi> how that when he was a praying,<note place="margin">Eunap. in vita Jambl.

                  </gap> above ten cubits, and his rayment ſeemed to ſhine with a brightneſs like to gold. But above all I deſire the Reader to take notice of what <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſaith of the <hi>Moſſaliani</hi> or <hi>Prayers,</hi> that they uſed to do nothing elſe, and would not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low any calling, but when they did not
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:170332:163"/>pray, they fell aſleep.<note place="margin">L. <hi>4.</hi> Eccleſ. hiſt. cap. <hi>10.</hi> &amp; L. <hi>4.</hi> haeret. fab. cap. <hi>11.</hi>
                  </note> And then they thought that they beheld Viſions, and could propheſie, and ſaw the <hi>ſacred Trinity</hi> with their eyes. They ſaid that there was an evil ſpirit in all men which muſt be caſt out by <hi>prayers,</hi> and then the holy Spirit of God comes in: after which there was no need of faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for to humble the body, nor of any doctrine or teaching which bridles and guides the motion of the body, but the <hi>Spirit</hi> doth all. One egg is not more like another then thoſe men were like them among us who ſay they are <hi>above all Ordinances.</hi> They feel ſome heat in their hearts when they pray, and they are lifted up in ſome kind of pious thoughts by the ſtrong workings of their own melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly fancies; and then they think that this is to them inſtead of all other things, ſo that the Lords Supper is but a carnal Feaſt, and the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are but dead letters; and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are but School-maſters for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and fools.</p>
               <p n="5">5. So much of the Phariſee is ſtill among us, that it would make any
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:170332:164"/>godly ſoul bluſh to ſee what foul things are done by thoſe that make very fair pretences to God in their prayers. The meaſure of which many times is length and loudneſs, many words and much heat, whileſt there is no true ſpiritual life and ſenſe of God which breaths forth their ſouls unto him. Men care not to be as long in <hi>confeſsing</hi> of their ſins as they intend to be in leaving of them, if it will but paſs current for Religion. They will pray for <hi>forgiveneſs</hi> of their ſins as often as God pleaſes, ſo they may but have leave when they ſee occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to commit them. They will call for that <hi>ſtrength</hi> and power which they never mean to uſe, for that <hi>Spirit</hi> of holineſs which they would not have ſo kind as to come and trouble them in their enjoyments. They pray for that <hi>light</hi> which they would not have to look too broad in their faces, for that <hi>purity and ſanctity</hi> which they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow no more upon then a prayer to obtain; and if they knew what they prayed for, they would be loth to have an Anſwer. They beg that <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:170332:164"/>the ſpring of which they would be loth ſhould dwell within them; that <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of Chriſt which they would have to cover all their filthineſs and keep them warm in their ſins; that <hi>blood of Jeſus</hi> which ſhould quench the fiery indignation which they ſay, but think not, that their ſins do deſerve.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And yet I have told you the beſt of this ſort of Religioniſts; for there are that think they ſhall be heard for their <hi>much babling,</hi> and are little better then heatheniſh worſhippers. They are rude and ſenſleſs in their <hi>Tautologies</hi> without any real and unforc't affection. Their prayers are a confuſed, indigeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heap of words, raſh and bold ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; irreverent and unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing addreſſes to the glorious majeſty of heaven; fulſome and nauſeating language, ſavouring of an unprepared though haſty; careleſs, though confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent mind. They are meaſured by the glaſs, and muſt be ſtretched, though by heatheniſh repetitions, <hi>i. e.</hi> without any order or handſom zeal, to ſuch a certain length. And if a <hi>childiſh tone,</hi> like that when
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:170332:165"/>they ſay their leſſons, can help out theſe devotions, it is accounted a great token of good affection and a ſign that a man is more then ordinarily moved. If the voice likewiſe be loud &amp; ſonorous, moſt people are apt to think the heavens will hear thoſe prayers ſooner then others, as coming from the greateſt zeal and fervency of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. But all good Chriſtians, whoſe hearts are in their prayers, feel that the ſence of Gods <hi>Glory,</hi> as well as his <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> fills their ſouls. Which makes them modeſt and humble, bluſhing and baſhfull before his face; reverent and compoſed, ſolemn and ſedate in their ſpeech unto him: Serious in their zeal and zealous in their repetitions: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand in what they ask, and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſirous to receive it. And above all, they know that an holy life is moſt pleaſing unto God, whereby they do continually beſpeak his favour, and are alwayes ſending up Orators to the throne of grace to bring down more bleſſings upon them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And if any one have a liſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the bottom of this deceit,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:170332:165"/>I believe he will find that many mens prayers are but a <hi>piece of Art</hi> which they have learnt by imitation of others, whoſe language and affection they moſt admired; from whom they have borrowed ſuch feeling expreſſions as won their ſouls to ſome endeavours to be like them. I have ſometimes thought that an <hi>hypocrite</hi> is rather a counterfeit of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> then of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for he doth not ſo much ſhape himſelf accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what he reads of <hi>him,</hi> as what he ſees in <hi>them.</hi> He is but their Ape, and never more diſcovers himſelf then when he labours to imitate their zeal, and to come up to the height of their piety. As Apes are never more like themſelves then when they do <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (as <hi>Lucian</hi> ſomewhere ſpeaks) put on the face and garb of Noble men; ſo the higher ſtrains of devotion they endeavour to perſonate, the more their affectation and fulſome forcedneſs appears. Or as the deeper any women paint, the more plainly is their diſſembled complexion ſeen; ſo the more colours theſe men lay on, and the greater ruddineſs of zeal they
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:170332:166"/>would attain unto, the more is their uglineſs revealed, and the falſe beauty of their holineſs laid open to the world. As it is in thoſe <hi>Meteors</hi> which they call <hi>parelia,</hi> when two Suns appear to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether beſides the great light of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;<note place="margin">Cap. <hi>13.</hi> nat. quaeſt.</note> the one ſaith <hi>Seneca</hi> is <hi>ſimulacrum Solis,</hi> the picture or image of the Sun; the other is <hi>ſimulacrum imaginis,</hi> the picture or image of the eimage: ſo it is in this caſe; a good man is the image of Chriſt the Sun of righteouſneſs; but an hypocrite is only the image. of the good man, not of Chriſt, having only a picture of his righteouſneſs. And yet theſe pictures and images of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians may ſeem to ſome to excell the coppy, and be more admired then good and religious people. As a picture in a room is by Art ſo drawn, that it ſeems to look upon every one in it on what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſide you ſtand; whereas a living man doth look but one way: ſo theſe artificial pieces have a more notable way of looking graciouſly upon the multitude then real Chriſtians have, who appear moſt lovely to thoſe that have the ſpirit of life ruling in them.</p>
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:170332:166"/>
               <p n="8">8. And if theſe <hi>Artiſts</hi> have an active fancy and a natural heat, it will much promote their good opinion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, becauſe their devotions will be beyond the vulgar ſtrain. For a quick fancy can adminiſter very apt words and fluent expreſſions that ſhall not juſtle one againſt another, but run off very ſmoothly; and there is a kind of charm in dainty words well put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which roll off the tongue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any rub in their way. The natural heat alſo when it makes the animal ſpirits boil and leap up to a great height, can produce ſome affections and paſſions anſwerable to that ſree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of language which will have ſtill more of raviſhment and tranſportation in it. By the power of Imagination likewiſe being thus heated and chafed, unuſual thoughts may be raiſed up, and the mind may be filled with new notions, which men may take to be an argument of their being under the <hi>power</hi> of the Spirit; and their <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without a form</hi> may ſeem to them to be a token of the power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But when this heat abates, and
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:170332:167"/>they ceaſe to be tickled with ſuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, then theſe men grow pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full creatures, and have no religion at all, unleſs they can comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with what they hear others alſo talk of, that they are under <hi>deſertion,</hi> and make this as much a ſign of grace, as they did their former enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p n="9">9. It muſt likewiſe be conſidered that the beginning and continuance of this devotion is to be imputed to the natural conſcience which men have of ſome duty owing unto God, and of ſome recompenſe that they ſtand bound to make him for their neglects of it. Though this conſcience when it is once awakned, cannot be ſatisfied, unleſs they do ſomething to pleaſe him; yet it reſts commonly in that which is eaſie, and agrees beſt with their natural diſpoſitions, and leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts their inbred luſts and deſires. Now where there is that nimble fancy which I ſpoke of, and that voluble tongue, and ſpirits that can ſoon take fire by any motion; there is nothing more accommodated to the end of
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:170332:167"/>giving them ſatisfaction then <hi>prayer:</hi> becauſe ſuch people are naturally for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to talk, and can both with eaſe and pleaſure make long ſpeeches unto God. And when they have <hi>prayed</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a good opinion of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and favour with God, then as ſoon as their morning devotions are paſt, they may ſecurely lie all day long in hatred, malice, covetouſneſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, and ſuch like ſins, as though they had conſecrated and craved a bleſſing upon all their Actions.<note place="margin">Lib. 1. <hi>Eſſayes, chap.</hi> 56.</note> And ſo <hi>Mount aigne</hi> tells us that there was a young Prince, who when he went about any leud and unchaſte deſign, would alwayes go into that Church which was in his way both as he went and as he returned from his filthineſs; &amp; this was told him by a great perſon as an inſtance of ſpecial and ſingular devotion. But let any impartiall man tell me (ſaith he) to what purpoſe he invoked and called on God for his divine favour, having his mind whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bent to ſin, and his thoughts ſet on laſciviouſneſs. And yet thus it is, every man calls upon God, it matters not
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:170332:168"/>for what; the covetous, the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the theef, all pray God to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed their enterpriſes; which is juſt as if a Cut-purſe ſhould call in juſtice for his aid, and as if we ſhould call God to witneſs to a lie. And there he adds this golden ſaying; <hi>Verily it ſeemeth that we make no other uſe of our prayers, then of a company of gibberiſh phraſes; or as thoſe that imploy holy and ſacred words about witchcraft and magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal effects; and that we magine their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect dependeth on the contexture, or ſound, or ſucceſsion of words, or on our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. For mans ſoul being full fraught with luſts, and nothing touched with repentance; they headlong preſent unto him thoſe heedleſs words that memory af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth their tongue, by which they hope to obtain an expiation of all their offences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. I ſhall hereunto annex briefly another way of deceiving mens ſelves, which is by a whining, puling <hi>kind of religion,</hi> that many have taken up (I muſt deſire the Reader to bear with ſuch expreſſions, becauſe I know not how to diſcribe this form of cozenage
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:170332:168"/>better) who are alwayes complaining of their corruptions, their deadneſs in duties, that they cannot profit by Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, nor find themſelves inlarged in prayer, and ſuch like things. I ſpeak not now of the ſober complaints which a good ſoul may make upon ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, but of a conſtant way and life of ſame people, who for many years, are in the ſome dolefull and querulous tone; exerciſing a continual peddling trade of going from houſe to houſe to tell their ſtories. And as you may obſerve that it is an eaſe to ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy people to be relating their griefs and aches, and to ſhed tears when their neighbours come in, for every little thing that troubles them; So I believe that theſe perſons take ſome pleaſure in their whining, and it is apt to ſtir in them ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which they look upon as a ſign of grace, and a mark at leaſt of that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility which the Scripture ſo much calls for: Eſpecially if they bemoan their <hi>hypocriſie</hi> and falſeneſs of heart, they are ready to think that they have a great deal of <hi>ſincerity:</hi> Whereas it
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:170332:169"/>is too true that they are as rotten as they ſay, becauſe they do not grow better, nor make any progreſs from this whimpering childiſh condition to a State of man-like piety. It is not ſufficient to make us good, to tell God and man that we are bad: And to ſigh over our ſelves makes our caſe worſe: if it do not make us better.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. FROM this piece of falſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which I have noted in the <hi>Phariſee,</hi> I ſhall come to ſome other which our Saviour obſerves in the ſame chapter (<hi>Mat.</hi> 23.) where he ſpeaks of this. And the firſt that we meet withall is their <hi>ſeparating</hi> of themſelves from all others, which is the very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:170332:170"/>of the word <hi>Phariſee</hi> (as the moſt learned conclude) which ſignifies <hi>one ſeparated.</hi> And this they did, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by taking upon them more cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious obſervances then others, and by abhorring common company, but alſo by their garments, their outward garb and deportment. They wore long robes, they made broad their phylacteries, and inlarged the fringes of their garments, which were characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical notes to diſtinguiſh them from others. But there was a ſtrange pride and love to be eſteemed by others, and impatience of being deſpiſed and undervalued, that diſcovered it ſelf in all their actions. For they affected the chief place at feaſts, and would not indure a prophane man to take the wall of them, and loved to be adored as great Rabbies, and received all the honour that was put upon them as their due deſerts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is to be feared that many at this day take themſelves upon no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter account to be good, but becauſe they are not among the bad: And that others think themſelves the moſt
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:170332:170"/>excellent Chriſtians, becauſe they are <hi>ſeparated</hi> and divided from thoſe that do not take themſelves ſo to be. When men are once imbodied in diſtinct ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, and are, though not cloyſtered, yet, gathered from the reſt of the world, they take this ſmall ſtrictneſs to be <hi>the ſeparation</hi> (which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks of) <hi>from the unclean, and the coming out from among the wicked.</hi> Whereas the heart of many ſuch (for I ſpeak not of all) is ſtill among the crowd of the ungodly, their affections are as dirty, their paſſions as dark and black, as theirs that lie ſtill in the open ſtreets, and are not thus incloſed from others. For whence elſe is it that they take themſelves to deſerve all places of preferment, and to be imployed in the greateſt affairs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it very ill if their Piety be not moſt made of by thoſe that are in place of power and authority? Do they not ſcramble for the world as well as their neighbours? are they not proud and ſupercilious? Do they not look down from their pearch with a diſdain of their Brethren? If not, then are they
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:170332:171"/>happily ſeparated by theſe good quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from the world; but if they do, it is not their aſſociation with the good, nor the living in a Fraternity, that will impale them from the herd of brutiſh men. If theſe fruits of the fleſh be found in any company of men, high contempt and ſcorn of others, a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of contradiction, rebellion and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; unnatural affection, injuſtice and cruelty, hatred and envy, unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and hardheartedneſs to the poor, rigour and ſternneſs to thoſe that diſſent from them and are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mind, they muſt be content to be told that their Religion is but vain and will vaniſh away: Its root ſhall be rottenneſs, and its bloſſome ſhall go up as the duſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A <hi>Second</hi> thing that we meet with all as notorious among thoſe <hi>Phariſees,</hi> was a zeal to promote and ſpread their own opinion, which no queſtion many take to be an argument of great love to God, who is more they think con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it then themſelves. And this diſcovered it ſelf in two things, 1. In their wonderfull diligence that they
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:170332:171"/>uſed to make but one proſelyte, <hi>v.</hi> 15. They would go a whole country over, yea and take ſhip alſo to fiſh but for one diſciple to <hi>their</hi> belief. <hi>Theirs</hi> I ſay, for they did not make them reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, but only brought them over to their party; they did not labour ſo much their converſion, as to maintain and ſupport their own faction. And if he was not a hater of others before, they made him twofold more the child of the Devil then themſelves, full of all hatred, ſpite and cruelty againſt thoſe that were not of their gang. And that indeed was the <hi>Second</hi> thing wherein their falſe zeal appeared; a ſtrange fierceneſs againſt all of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſenſe, ſo that they would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure there ſhould be any other perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but anathematized all thoſe that were not of their way, <hi>v.</hi> 13. If any man ſpoke well of our Saviour, and confeſſed him to be the Chriſt, they caſt him out of the Synagogue; and if he were a noted man, they ſought to deſtroy him, and caſt him out of the world, as they thought to do <hi>Lazarus.</hi> And eſpecially take notice of what
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:170332:172"/>was ſaid a little before, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes who were converted by them, and received the Jewiſh ſpirit, were the moſt bitter fellows of all: as they commonly among us who are Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to a deluder, are far more violent (for a proof I think either of their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity or proficiency) then the Maſter of whom they learn their leſſons.</p>
               <p n="4">4. So eaſie a thing it is to endeavour to deſtroy others, when we think that will ſave our ſelves; and ſo glad is ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of ſuch an opportunity to vent all its fury without any fear a reproof, but with great commendations for its pains. And ſo well content likewiſe will mens falſe hearts be to labour ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make others of their mind, then to make them good; to make their neighbours like to themſelves, then to make themſelves like to God. There is ſome labour and difficulty in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the old man, and in graving the face of God upon our ſouls in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and true holineſs: but to ſtamp our own image upon other mens minds, and to beget children to our ſelves, is a thing to which nature is
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:170332:172"/>prone, and wenderfully tickled in the doing of it. To walk with God <hi>unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed in the way</hi> requires great caution, watchfulneſs and circumſpection: but it is no ſuch hard thing as men imagine, to <hi>walk</hi> over a whole country and tell them that they are damned: that they muſt be baptized again, that they muſt forſake the Church, and bid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance to all Prieſts, with things of the like nature. There is as much car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality and ſenſual pleaſure in theſe things, as there is in the moſt laſcivious actions of fleſhlymen. They are <hi>inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> with their Opinions, as <hi>Judah</hi> was with Idols: they have an itching deſire to be pouring out their conceits into the womb of every ſoul that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them. Let all men therefore take heed how they judge themſelves godly becauſe they are hot and ardent in their deſires to have all of their way: for this may be but ſelf-love, or a tyrannous deſire to have all wills humbled and bowed down to theirs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To this we will ſubjoyn a <hi>third</hi> thing, becauſe very nearly allied with the former, and that was <hi>their oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:170332:173"/>to the bad party.</hi> This diſcourſe of our Saviours in <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. is occaſioned by the flocking of the Phariſees to him, who were mighty glad that he had put the dull <hi>Saduces</hi> to ſilence, <hi>chap.</hi> 22.34, 41. A great abhorrence they had of thoſe <hi>Epicurean</hi> principles which the <hi>Saduces</hi> held, and did ſtrenuouſly maintain a future ſtate and the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead, from whence they did conclude their zeal for God was as great as it was againſt the ungodly. And indeed in this did conſiſt a great part of the <hi>Jewiſh Hypocriſie;</hi> they had been ſoundly plagued for their <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> and <hi>Sabbath-breaking:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſtudied at laſt to get as far off from the Gentiles as they could, which they took for a mark of great reformation. So you may obſerve throughout the whole new Teſtament, that they would not eat with a Gentile, and they abhorred Idols; they were ready to kill our Saviour becauſe he did works of mercy on their Sabbath. And it is held unlawfull by their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors but to ſtoop down to drink of the water that flows from a Statue,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:170332:173"/>leſt they ſhould fall into the ſuſpition of worſhipping before an Idol. And ſo for the Sabbath they were ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, that they tell us the <hi>Lamb of the Paſſeover</hi> which uſed at other times to be hung upon a ſtaff or barr which lay on two mens ſhoulders, and ſo flead as it hung between them (there being more at that time offered then could be flead in the court) if the Paſſeover fell on the Sabbath, then a man laid his hand upon his fellows ſhoulder, and his fellow laid his hand on his, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their arms the Lamb was hanged and flead by another neighbour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not lawfull that day to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a burden. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> you know threatens them (<hi>chap.</hi> 17.) for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying burdens on the Sabbath day; and therefore they were ſo fearfull of it, that they would not venture ſo much as to lay a ſtaffe upon their ſhoulders which would have weighed no more then their hands.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Would not you have taken theſe men for very pious and tender ſouls who were ſo wary leſt they ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend God, and bare ſuch an hatred to
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:170332:174"/>all <hi>parties</hi> that were irreligious? Yes ſure, they would have paſſed for men of ſingular devotion in theſe dayes; and if they were alive among us, men would take up the old ſaying, that <hi>if but two perſons ſhould go to heaven, the one ſhould be a Scribe, and the other a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee.</hi> And yet alas! theſe men who abhorred Idols ſo much, had a great abominable image of the world in their hearts, and Mammon they daily ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. They hated the <hi>Saduces</hi> more then they did their Opinion: and they remembred the keeping of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath ſo well, that they broke the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry next command to it, and honoured their Father and Mother no more then they pleaſed. The carnal worldly Proteſtant is juſt their Ape; He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not indure the ſight of a Croſs, he is ready to tear the picture of a Saint in pieces; but he himſelf is only a picture of real Saints: a meer Statue, and as cold as a ſtone to all Chriſtian vertues. He loves the ſin of domineering over his Brethren: of dictating from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Spirit: of heaping up riches, and inlarging his poſſeſſions as much
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:170332:174"/>as his life; which perhaps he is ready to ſacrifice for the ſubduing of Gods enemies. For ſo it ſometimes is, that this <hi>oppoſition</hi> to a bad party is accompanied with ſuch a notable hot zeal, that makes men willing to die in the quarrel; but this zeal is very black and ſooty, and it ſends up ſuch a reek as miſerably fouls the Soul.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Before I come to that thing which I ſhall chiefly mark in <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. You may note ſome colder formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and more beggerly ceremonies then theſe I have mentioned, which are ſpoken of in other places, and made a ſhift to creep under the name of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the world. They <hi>faſted</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often, and made it known to all the neighbour-hood by covering and hooding of their faces, as they uſed to do in time of mourning, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.10. They thought themſelves defiled by the vulgar, the people of the earth, and would marvel (as the <hi>Evang.</hi> tells us, <hi>Mark.</hi> 7.) if a man did not waſh when he came to eat, or when he came from the market. They might wear pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps rough garments, as the Prophets
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:170332:175"/>did (ſuch hairy cloths as <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> uſed,) in token of a courſe, hard and ſevere life, as a ſign of great mortification; but it was only to <hi>deceive</hi> (as the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> ſpeaks <hi>chap.</hi> 13.4.) and that they might make a prey of ſimple and well-meaning people. Abundance of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany lurked under their <hi>hoods,</hi> and their hands which they waſhed, were full of blood and covetouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I will not ſay what knavery lies under a <hi>Friers</hi> frock, nor what wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs is <hi>cloyſtered</hi> from the eye of the world, under pretence of Religion, becauſe I am not acquainted with their practiſes, but only by report; but let us look at home, and ſee if we can find none of this <hi>courſe, barden religion,</hi> which conſiſts altogether in corporal auſteries. Some we have ſeen making as much ado about ſuch a cut of their hair, as thoſe <hi>Friars</hi> about a ſhaven crown, and as fierce for the cuting off their ribbons, as if it was the cutting off our right hand, which our Saviour ſpeaks of. And others we have ſeen to faſt, and puniſh their bodies, and make them do
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:170332:175"/>pennance by an hard life, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding have been hard to the poor, and harſh and ſowr to to others as well as to themſelves. They look upon theſe things as great marks of humility; but as <hi>David Chytraeus</hi> well ſaith (with whoſe words none will be offended, though they may with mine) <hi>Forma humilitatis eſt, non dejectio capitis in alterum latus, non veſtis ſordida,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Reg. Vitae.</note> Humility doth not conſiſt in holding ones head awry, in wearing of poor cloaths, or any other externall geſture; but in the hearty caſting down of our ſelves before God, and ſubjecting our wills to his, to do and ſuffer what he pleaſes.</p>
               <p n="9">9. They commended likewiſe good men, but eſpecially thoſe that were dead and gone, garniſhing the very ſepulchres of the Prophets. And not a ſmall piece of Religion is it now adaies, to commend the Preacher, as the woman did our Saviour, ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed is the womb that bare thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.27. <hi>O he is a pretious man, a ſweet teacher, I could hang on his lips all day long;</hi> though they are no wiſer
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:170332:176"/>nor better by all the Sermons they hear, then they were many years ago. To throng to the Church, to uſe devout carriage there, demure looks, ſad ſighs and groans, a ſowr face, a ſtudied tone, a deliberate gate, will go a great way in many mens Religion. And on the contrary, There are ſome who pride themſelves in decrying all theſe poor formalities which we have named, in ſcufling and fighting with theſe ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of Religion; dealing more blows at theſe airy appearances, then at foul and deadly ſins. Both of theſe men are of the ſame Genius, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating themſelves to the mode and faſhion of the times: imitating, as far as they dare with ſafety to their ſins, thoſe who are taken to be truly Religious. They would wear the cloaths, but not be the men: they would fain have theſe things, to be put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on of Jeſus Chriſt, but like not a religion that will lie near the heart, and make them put off themſelves. And indeed when I have conſidered all things, I find that there is nothing ſo poor and mean about which men
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:170332:176"/>may not ſpend their zeal ſo exceſſively, that it may paſs with them for a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They would have the <hi>kisſing of the Son,</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.12. to be but ſuch a ceremony as the kiſſing of the hand was among the heathen when they worſhipped: bowing and kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the Lord our maker, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. they can eaſily think to be no more but bending their hams, bowing their bodies before him. Praying and lifting up the ſoul to God, to be but turning up the eyes, and lifting up the hands; purifying and cleanſing to be nothing elſe but outward Baptiſm: and receiving of Chriſt to be eating and drinking of the Bread and Wine in the Lords Supper. And all the great duties of a Chriſtian to be fulfilled in a good will to them, which God will accept inſtead of the deed.</p>
               <p n="10">10. We muſt learn therefore not to Judge of men by their talk and brave expreſſions, by their little ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and trifling zeal, or any thing that is cheap and eaſie, but by their ſelf-denial and abaſing of themſelves, and by all real acts of righteouſneſs
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:170332:177"/>which are chargeable and coſt them ſomething. As they ſay, that at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> they will give you the title of <hi>Magnifico,</hi> and ſolemnly invite you to their houſes to dinner, but if you accept of the invitation, and expect what they profeſs, it is a piece of the greateſt rudeneſs, incivility and ill breeding: Even ſo it is here: there are many men that ſpeak honourably of God, and ſeem to be very deſirous of his company, and invite him to their ſouls by many prayers and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt petitions, that promiſe him fair, and profeſs great reſpect to him; but he is ignorant and rude in the world who expects they will be as good as their word, and they themſelves take it very ill that God ſhould require all that at their hand. They love to talk of Remiſſion and reconciliation; the flowing forth of Chriſts blood; the bleeding his heart to ſinners; the freeneſs of his grace; and twenty ſuch good words, and phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. They will chat all day long of fulneſs and freeneſs, of riches and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, communion and communication;
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:170332:177"/>and ſuch like things, but you muſt not think that they mean any thing more then Chriſts caſting a covering over their ſins, and hiding their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities. Chriſt muſt ſpeak as much of their kindneſs and love alſo, if they be holy, for they ſee no obligation to ſuch exactneſs. And therefore all they beſtow on God is large promiſes, and ſome petty inconſiderable actions of obedience. If he will have more, he muſt take it of Chriſt, and not of them, for he is beſt able to pay what is owing. Though they are engaged and ſtand bound to God in many duties, yet they intended in concluſion to caſt the whole debt upon Chriſt, and to diſcharge little or none of it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And I cannot but admire at the ſtrange impudence of the world, who ordinarily brand the <hi>Miniſters</hi> with the name of <hi>Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they wear long cloaks, or have reſpect and honour from the people which they do not ſeek; though they be men of upright lives, and whoſe
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:170332:178"/>hands were never fouled with any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt gain; but ſtretched out many times to relieve thoſe that are in need: And yet never conſider how like they themſelvs are to thoſe perſons in their covetouſeneſs, hard-heartedneſs, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, deſperate malice, implacableneſs againſt all that oppoſe them; and other things of this high nature. All that bear any ſimilitude to their outward garb, muſt <hi>be hypocrites;</hi> and they that reſemble them in their dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical nature, muſt be <hi>Saints.</hi> Who can help it if men will be mad and conſider nothing? They themſelves perhaps make <hi>long prayers,</hi> as the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees did, and yet they would be loath (and ſo would I alſo,) that therefore they ſhould be eſteemed hypocrites; if all things elſe were correſpondent, and their lives were holy. They might learn then one would think (if they be not quite frantick) that the hypocriſie of the phariſees did not conſiſt in wearing long robes, or any ſuch outward thing, but in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their religion in them, and living under that ſhadow in all covetouſneſs,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:170332:178"/>pride, Lordlineſs over their Brethren, ſpite, anger and deſire to deſtroy all contrary minded, and ſuch like wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs. If men be guilty of theſe things, then they are <hi>Phariſees</hi> in grain, though they wear <hi>ſhort cloaks,</hi> and are not called <hi>Maſters.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. AND this will lead me to the great mark of the <hi>Pharaſaick</hi>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:170332:179"/>ſpirit, which comprehends all the reſt; and <hi>that is a fierce zeal for ſome things, with a plain neglect of all the reſt.</hi> As it is eaſier to talk then to do, ſo ſome things are eaſier to be done then others. And if you read the Goſpel, you will ſee that they pickt out thoſe things that were of eaſie digeſtion, and would nouriſh their diſeaſes; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected every thing that might make them ſick, and vomit up all their fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs. To make this more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, I will inſtance in ſome particulars which clearly diſcover their partial and unequall zeal in performance of their duty. And <hi>Firſt,</hi> you may obſerve that they loved their own Traditions bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then they did Gods expreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. There are many learned men (and St. <hi>Hierom</hi> among the reſt) that think God did not command them to make <hi>Phylacteries,</hi> but only carefully to remember the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.8, 9. And yet they were more carefull to have theſe ſcripts of parchment about them, then to have the Law of God written on their hearts, which was contained in them. But though that
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:170332:180"/>be not certain, yet it is moſt indubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that God commanded them to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour their Father and Mother, but no where bids them offer and conſecrate all their eſtates to him: And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they took themſelves to be excuſed from all obligations to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their poor Parents,<note place="margin">So <hi>Theophylact</hi> interprets it.</note> if they could but ſay, that they had devoted all that as a gift to God, whereby they might do them any good, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.5. which was a moſt lenſleſs thing, and as if what was given to the poor, eſpecially to our parents, were not given to Gods uſes. And yet now at this day, men are wont to ſwagger more in a new faſhion, and late invention in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of their own contriving, then to contend earneſtly for the manifeſt precepts of our Lord Ieſus. They are all on a fire for a doubtfull opinion, for a mode of Government which relies on no clear Scripture: but have ſcarce any ſenſible heat for that <hi>love</hi> and charity which Chriſt hath undeniably commended over and over again to his diſciples.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Second thing which you may
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:170332:180"/>obſerve in the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> is this, that they loved actions of Devotion to God better then actions of Mercy and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to men. That you may ſee by their <hi>long prayers, Mat.</hi> 23.14. and their <hi>Corbans,</hi> or gifts they offered to God, juſt now mentioned. There was more of Pomp and fame, but leſs of Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyall in the one then in the other; and they would alwayes chuſe that which was moſt eaſie, eſpecially if it conduced to their credit and glory. And therefore <hi>thirdly,</hi> you may obſerve that of all actions of Piety they choſe thoſe that were moſt <hi>outward,</hi> and done with leaſt trouble. As to <hi>praying</hi> they were much addicted; but with <hi>medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inward admirations</hi> of God, &amp; <hi>ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> of his excellencies we may be ſure they were little acquainted. And juſt ſo now it is; men think that actions of piety merit more of God then others do; and that he is ſo pleaſed with them, that he can be content if they overlook others, while they are ſo very kind to him: and therefore Mercy and Kindneſs to others are meer ſtrangers to them. And you may obſerve, that
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:170332:181"/>men had rather pray with others then alone by themſelves; and they account it a greater attainment to be a ſpeaker in a congregation, then to be humble and lowly-hearted. They are ſtrangers to inward and deep thoughts of God; for if they were acquainted with his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and goodneſs, they would mind nothing more then to purge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from all their filthy paſſions and affections, and to do good to all as he doth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And indeed <hi>fourthly,</hi> it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally true of them, that they loved that which was <hi>outward,</hi> more then that which was <hi>inward, Mat.</hi> 23.25, 28. And they loved that which agreed with their own humour, better then that which was againſt it, <hi>v.</hi> 15. They ſcoured the out-ſide, that it might ſhine and gliſter, and dazzle all mens eyes with its brightneſs: but they cared not how black or cankered they were within, and how vile they appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Gods eyes, ſo that all their neighbours would ſuſpect no foulneſs. And they endeavoured the converſion of others to their Religion, which
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:170332:181"/>did but feed their own vain humor and popular deſire of being accounted great and glorious Saints; while they took no care to turn their own hearts to God and true righteouſneſs, from which they had ſo monſtrouſly dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated. Of this ſort are all they who are highly zealous againſt all <hi>carnal</hi> ſins, but live in thoſe that are <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</hi> They hate all riot and drunkenneſs (as we all ought to do) but are drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken themſelves with rage, anger and pride. They reprove others ſharply, but cannot indure a fair reproof from others. They cry out perhaps againſt injuſtice, but think it no robbery to take away a mans good name. They deteſt unclean embraces, but yet have an unchaſte complacency in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their own Opinions. They would have no wicked men go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern us, but they think themſelves fit for their places, and are deſirous of preheminence.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A <hi>fifth</hi> token of their hypocriſie was, that they were more ſcrupulous in committing of a little ſin, then of a great. They would take falſe witneſs
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:170332:182"/>againſt Chriſt, though they would not enter in the Governours hall for fear of being defiled: Which was as if one ſhould ſtrain his liquor if there were a gnat in it, but make nothing of ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing a Camel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.24. The heat and ſap of their ſouls ſpent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſuch broad leavs and fruitleſs ſuckers, as you ſee in a Vine undreſſed: and he that ſhould but pluck off one leaf, ſtrike off one ceremony or uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded duty that they impoſed, was a greater enemy to God in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count then he that broke moſt of Gods Laws. He that knows the world, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſee that this leaven is not yet caſt out of mens hearts. We have many that are Chriſtians, juſt as <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> was a Souldier; <hi>that are enemies to flies, and flies to their enemies:</hi> Very braving and daring they are againſt that which is called <hi>Superſtition,</hi> but eaſily yielding to temptations to cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, deceit and unlawfull gain: or on the contrary, very fearfull to fail in a ceremony, but worſhipping the fleſh and living looſely. An Hypocrite is much imployed in little things, and
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:170332:182"/>buſied about the ſhadow and bark of religion, be it what it will. If religion be pompouſly &amp; gloriouſly cloathed, then he will ſtrive to be moſt ceremonious, coſtly and chargeable in his devotion: ſo that we may ſay of him as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher ſaid of a finical but empty Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, <hi>homo in cauſis agendis bene veſtitus,</hi> a neat man in his Religion; one that pleads with God in gorgeous appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel. But on the contrary, if men take to a ſide that loves to be ſordid and ſlovenly, and as careleſs as they can in all outward decencies, none ſhall more fiercely decry all ceremonies, nor more prophane all that was before accounted holy. And ſo in all other matters, the moſt inconſiderable among them exerciſe their zeal: and the weightieſt exerciſe only their fancies and tongues.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A <hi>Sixth</hi> thing to be noted in them is, that they would be juſt in one thing, that they might be unjuſt in another. <hi>v.</hi> 23. They would pay their tithes to the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> that this might cover all their acts of rapine and covetouſneſs among the people. And they did not only pay them, but were
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:170332:183"/>very ſcrupulous to pay them exactly, as if they would not wrong one of a Cummin ſeed, or a Speer of mint, or as we ſay, of the hair of one head; when as they neglected <hi>judgement,</hi> if any cauſes came before them; they ſhewed no <hi>mercy</hi> to the poor; and kept no <hi>faith</hi> in their Covenants and promiſes. It concerns a man to be very punctual with ſome perſons, and in his ordinary inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to keep to rules of juſtice; elſe he would be hiſſed out of the world, and he would have no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to deceive a ſimple or unwary ſoul. Much leſs would he be able when he ſtretches his conſcience to do a baſe action, to take himſelf ſtill for a godly man, if he did not at other times deal fairly. And therefore he is fain alſo to imitate the Phariſee in a <hi>Seventh</hi> quality, and that is, to <hi>do ſome great act of Charity, to excuſe himſelf from a conſtant exerciſe of it.</hi> It is like that theſe <hi>hypocrites</hi> which our Saviour ſpeaks of, paid the tythe which was due every third year for the uſe of them that were in need (<hi>Deut.</hi>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:170332:183"/>14.28.) as well as the yearly dues to the Miniſters of God in the Temple. And this great and expenſive charity they thought perhaps ſo highly of, that they never reproved themſelves for their miſerable and wretched cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs at all other times: As many men now whoſe fingers are very ſtiff, may chance to draw their purſe-ſtrings at ſome ſolemn time, or when they are much moved with a good Sermon of Alms-doing; who at other ſeaſons have hearts as hard as flints to the cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſities of their Brethren. Much of the Religion of men and their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity alſo knows its times and daies; if they be obſerved, God lends them (they think) the reſt of their lives to diſpoſe of as they pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And <hi>laſtly,</hi> they would not ſtick to do more then they were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that they might neglect Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Commands. For many think that the tythe of <hi>every herb</hi> (which they paid, <hi>Luke.</hi> 11.42.) was not due by the Law: but they could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to over-do in this caſe, that they
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:170332:184"/>might do nothing in others; to give theſe <hi>free-will</hi> offerings, that they might have their <hi>own wills</hi> in greater matters; ſo falſe is the heart of men, that they think an exceſs in what pleaſes them, will ſatisfie for all their defects in that which is moſt pleaſing unto God. As to keep whole daies of prayer is far more grateful to ſome, then to keep a continual watch over themſelves in all their dealings and converſes with others, and in all their own inward thoughts and deſires. They will leave no ſtone unturned to find out an Art or device to ſave themſelves from the trouble of Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and ſelf-denial. They will wriggle every way rather then be ſtrait and upright as God made them. Any labour or pains they will take to ſhift off the great Commandments of <hi>loving God with all their hearts, and ſouls, and ſtrength, and loving their neighbours as themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. The more need there is that men ſhould be earneſtly urged to ſearch into their hearts, and examine them well about theſe things, leſt
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:170332:184"/>there lie hid any of this leaven under many ſeeming actions of Godlineſs. Take heed leſt you wink at ſome evil affection which you bear a particular reſpect unto, and let it ſcape un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched when you profeſs to cleanſe your ſelves. Beware leſt you caſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a favourable look upon ſome duties of Religion, and look aſquint upon the reſt, or take no notice of them. Labour to remove all obſtructions, that <hi>Zeal</hi> may have a free paſſage through the whole frame of your ſouls, and that you may be equally ſpirited to every duty of Religion. And I ſhall commend theſe two things as of ſingular uſe and advantage to keep our hearts from ſelf deceit. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let men ſuſpect themſelves when they are moved with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary heat, and feel a great zeal agitating of them in ſome one thing which they undertake upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Religion. Let them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently begin to ask themſelves how they ſtand affected to all the reſt, and to feell how their pulſe beats in all things, eſpecially in the moſt
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:170332:185"/>ſpiritual actions. Or elſe it is a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand to one, that this zeal will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray them into hypocriſie, and they will place all their religion in it. And therefore ſearch well, if there be not ſome externall inducement which thou doſt not obſerve, ſome cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt end at the bottom, ſome wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to ſpare a foul and naſty deſire, which makes thee ſo zealous in that particular thing, which may be as a covering for thy coldneſs in other matters. Be not cheated by thy ſelf, into a belief that thou art religious, when thou beareſt not a love to all Gods Commandments; but labour impartially and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly to carry thy ſelf to every duty alike, and then thou maiſt be well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of thy ſincerity in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let every man obſerve what it is that he is moſt in danger to neglect, when his Spirit is forwardly carried towards one thing. There is alwaies ſome one duty more then others, that a partial zeal is apt to devour. Be
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:170332:185"/>ſure therefore to <hi>take heed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of covetouſneſs,</hi> while you cry out againſt <hi>profaneneſs.</hi> Be as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to maintain love in your heart to your Brethren, as you are to obſerve them, reprove them, or to make them of your mind. Be as humble, lowly, and poor in ſpirit, as you are ready to diſtribute, to relieve the poor, or deſpiſe the world. Labour to be in as great charity with your enemies, to love them, pray for them, and bleſs them, as you are willing and perhaps forward to haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard your ſelves in a good cauſe. Be as conſciencious in following the Miniſters Doctrine as in paying of him his tithes, and ſpeaking well of him: As zealous in doing as you are in hearing; as carefull to uſe Gods grace as to beg it; to live to God, as to pray to him. And Saint <hi>James</hi> gives us the reaſon, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.22. That we ſhall other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>deceive our own ſouls.</hi> We ſhall have only ſo much religion as will ſerve to cozen our ſelves: as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a man doth who hears Gods
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:170332:186"/>word, and prayes, and is much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; but makes no conſcience of laying it to his heart by ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſideration, and working of it into the frame of his ſpririt, that he may live according to it.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. BUT you may well wonder how men ſo knowing as they were, ſhould overlook the moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary things which are ſo legible in the Book of God, and perſwade themſelves that they were pious, notwithſtanding
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:170332:187"/>ſuch palpable neglects. Sure theſe men had a moſt notable wit, which could invent ſuch cunning diſtinctions as ſhould allow them to break all Gods Commandments while they ſeemed to keep them. And ſo they had, as our Saviour tells, <hi>Mat</hi> 23, 16, 17, &amp;c. where you may ſee that they did abſolve men even from their oaths that were made by holy things, (<hi>viz</hi> the <hi>Temple</hi> and the <hi>Altar</hi>) if they were not made by that which they moſt loved, the <hi>Gold</hi> and the <hi>Gift.</hi> It is ſo ſenſeleſs a diſtinction whereby they freed men who had ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemny ſworn (as our Saviour plainly proves to them) that we cannot but think it was invented by groſs cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, and yet with a ſhew of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to God in preferring the <hi>Gold</hi> that was brought to his treaſury, and the <hi>gifts</hi> to his Altar above all other things in ſacredneſs. And ſo they defeated another command concerning the giving of honour to our Parents, by making a vow that all they got ſhould be as a <hi>Sacred thing</hi> to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, <hi>i. e.</hi> it ſhould be as unlawfull
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:170332:187"/>for them to have any of their <hi>goods,</hi> as to enjoy that which was devoted to God. For ſo they that are beſt skilled in the Jewiſh learning do expound that place,<note place="margin">V. J.<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Coch. in duns Tit. Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud. cap. <hi>7.</hi> Sanhedr.</note> 
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.5. though ſome of the Fathers (as I have already ſaid) think that it ſpeaks of conſecrating their goods to the treaſury of God. This was a rare way to be rich, by <hi>vowing</hi> not ſo much as to give their parents a mite of their goods; and a great piece of religion no queſtion they thought it to keep ſuch a vow when they had made it. This was a ſubtile Art to be covetous, and under a religious tye both together.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But theſe are no more then trifles in compare with that tranſcendent trick, which abſolves a man at once from as many duties as he pleaſes. That rare device was this, <hi>That if a man obſerved but one command well, it was not abſolutely neceſſary that he ſhould keep the reſt.</hi>

                  </note> So <hi>R. Chanania</hi> ſaith, that God would have <hi>Iſrael</hi> increaſe in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and therefore it was that he mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied ſo many precepts. It was not abſolutely neceſſary that they ſhould
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:170332:188"/>obſerve them all; but they ſhould merit exceedingly if they did. For ſo <hi>Maimon</hi> obſerves in his Comment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that place cited in the margin, <hi>If any of</hi> Iſrael <hi>keep one of the ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirteen precepts as he ought, out of love, and without a mixture of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſigns, he ſhall have a portion in the world to come.</hi> Many evaſions will mens own luſts and deſires ſuggeſt to them for the caſting off the weight of any duty that lyes upon them; but <hi>this</hi> is ſuch a notorious gloſs, that by it they might ſlip their necks from the yoke of every command, but that which they could be content to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And you muſt not think the fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtian is at a loſs for the like di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, interpretations and gloſſes, for to ſerve the dear intereſt of his ſins. Loth he is to break a Law, unleſs he ſeem to himſelf to keep it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here his wit ſteps in, and offers its help to ſalve his conſcience, and his profit or pleaſure both together. I ſhall take the liberty to inſtance in a few, which are eaſie to obſerve, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:170332:188"/>I doubt men will make a ſhift to underſtand nothing that concerns them by all that I ſay, unleſs I deſcend to particulars. <hi>Firſt</hi> therefore, if a man have uſe for a ſin, as ſuppoſe the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an oath, he can diſtinguiſh between the <hi>Letter</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of it. He can eaſily perſwade himſelf that he keeps the prime meaning (which is according as he pleaſes to have it) though he go contrary to the ſound of the words, and the ſenſe in which men commonly underſtand it. And thus thoſe perſons in <hi>New England</hi> who made ſo great a diſturbance,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Welds</hi> relation.</note> 
                  <hi>An.</hi> 1636. evacuated and blotted out the whole body of Chriſtian precepts, and did not leave ſo much as the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees (who thought obedience to one precept at leaſt to be neceſſary) ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That the letter of all the Scriptures were for a Covenant of works; but the Spirit of them held forth a Covenant of free grace.</hi> This was a rare anſwer when they were urged with ſeveral places of Holy Writ that proved the neceſſity of <hi>Sanctification</hi> and <hi>inward righteouſneſs;</hi> which they turned out
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:170332:189"/>of doors under the pretence of <hi>let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Chriſt.</hi> If it were ſaid that we muſt become <hi>new creatures,</hi> the Anſwer was ready, that by the <hi>new creature is meant Chriſt,</hi> and therefore we muſt only get into Chriſt. If it were ſaid, we muſt be <hi>holy as God is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> this was the return, that Chriſt is our ſanctification, and that <hi>there is no inherent righteouſneſs in us, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in him.</hi> And whereas the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. they ſaid, <hi>a man might have all grace, and yet want Chriſt.</hi> This was the ſecret ſenſe, the Spirit of the Scriptures, <hi>That we need do nothing, and Chriſt hath done all.</hi> This was <hi>holding forth naked Chriſt,</hi> as they called it: ſo <hi>naked</hi> indeed, that it is a ſhame to ſpeak of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If men cannot attain to this height of ſecret intelligence (which the old <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> likewiſe boaſted of) but they muſt acknowledge that ſenſe which we receive of Gods precepts; then they have another little device to ſave them the labour of yielding obedience; and that is called <hi>Providence,</hi> which is able
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:170332:189"/>to juſtifie any action againſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Gods word. If they have ſomething to accompliſh which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law and Juſtice, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience boggles at it; then becauſe they have a mind to keep friends with God, if he be content upon fair terms, they will intitle him ſome way or other to it, and they will not do it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his <hi>Providence</hi> lead them to it. And this hath been ſwallowed for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſweet doctrine by ſome Grandees (as I am well aſſured) <hi>That a man may follow providence againſt a precept.</hi> And ſo a theef (I have often times thought) who going by an houſe ſees the door open, and a fair plate inviting of him, no body within to deter him, may ſtand and admire at <hi>this ſtrange provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> that he ſhould come in that nick of time when all things concur to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to juſtifie his theft, to which he hath ſo <hi>loud a call.</hi> And if he ſhould at that time be thinking of another thing, and this plate likewiſe ſhould happen to have his name upon it, how ſhould he chuſe but hold up his hands and ſay, that he was lead to it by the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:170332:190"/>hand of heaven. I would have any one to tell himſelf how his caſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from this, who when a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things uſually meet together to make up a temptation (for it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe) to draw him to do an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full action, he ſaith, that <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> hath ſo ordered it, he did not intend it, but that he hath a <hi>call.</hi> And truly I believe he hath a <hi>call</hi> from his own importune and bawling defires; and <hi>Providence</hi> I know diſpoſes of all things, and often ſets us in ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances as we ſhall be tryed how we will behave our ſelves, and prove us how we will do our known duty.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But if this fail, there is a <hi>third</hi> thing ſo powerfull that nothing can reſiſt it, and that is <hi>a ſecret impulſe</hi> and inward motion miſtaken for <hi>inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> There is no act ſo guilty which this is not able to ſet a good face upon; no cauſe ſo foul which this cannot juſtifie with a goodly pretence. The <hi>Zealots</hi> among the Jews covered abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of murders and other inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies under the name of ſuch a divine ſpirit as moved <hi>Phineas.</hi> All the Jews
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:170332:190"/>had a tang of this fiery zeal, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ruſh like madmen with their ſtones upon St. <hi>Paul</hi> and others, to vindicate their Law from the contempt which they imagined was caſt upon it. And ſo all men that are pricked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſpurr'd on by their own am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious covetous deſires, or their revengefull and angry paſſions; may eaſily think that they feel ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign <hi>impulſe,</hi> becauſe they are thruſt on by no ſmall violence. Their own longings are wings large enough to mount up their ſoul, and carry them like an Eagle to his prey. Their own deſires can inſpire them, and impregnate their ſails, without any other ſpirit to breath upon them. There is ſo much fire naturally with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, that none need deſcend, nor aſcend to ſtimulate their ſouls to any beloved enterpriſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But if men be not of ſo high ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits as to have a touch of <hi>Enthuſiaſm;</hi> there is a <hi>fourth</hi> thing called <hi>neceſsity</hi> which hath no Law.<note place="margin">In Apolog.</note> 
                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> indeed was ſo ſimple as to ſay in the name of the old <hi>ſouldiers</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, that
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:170332:191"/>
                  <hi>Nulla eſt neceſsitas peccandi, quibus una eſt neceſsitas non peccandi; there can be no neceſsity of ſinning, to them who have one neceſsity lying upon them of not ſinning.</hi> But there are <hi>blades</hi> now of a purer make and a ſharper edge, who cut aſunder thoſe Iron chains of <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity</hi> it ſelf wherein thoſe groſſer ſouls were fettered. Though it be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for ſuch as us (who follow the old ſteps) not to ſin; yet it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to them to ſin, but they think it not to be a ſin, becauſe it is neceſſary. But they had beſt look to it, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der who is the author of that neceſſity, and not when they have run themſelves into a ſtrait, think that God gives them leave to break an hedge. Let them not think to eſcape better with all theſe pittifull ſhifts, then a theef doth, who when he hath rob'd a man of his money, thinks it neceſſary for to make all ſure to cut his throat. It is a neceſſity which he himſelf creates, and he muſt either make it good againſt the other of not ſinning, which is of Gods creating, or elſe it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that he ſuffer ſoundly both for
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:170332:191"/>ſinning, and for making it neceſſary to ſin.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And if it be ſaid (as it muſt,) That there is no neceſſity that they or any other men ſhould be great, or rich, or live in the world, and therefore they ſhould not do an illegall action for the ſaving of life it ſelf; They have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtinction ready at hand, which is, <hi>That all is done for Gods Glory,</hi> and we are not always to tread in the ordinary path to accompliſh that. A man may ſtep out of his way for Chriſts ſake; and he is mightily beholden (you may think) unto him, that he will ſin even againſt his conſcience for his honour. What can he do more for Chriſt then ſacrifice his very ſoul, and damn himſelf to make him glorious? Sure Chriſt will catch hold on ſuch loving friends of his: and not ſuffer them to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that damnation which they ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at, ſeeing it was for him. Juſt as Polititians, when they do unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table actions, think to excuſe them with the <hi>Reaſon of State,</hi> and <hi>pretence of common Good:</hi> So do other men think to ſhelter all their evil doings
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:170332:192"/>under the wings of Chriſt, and drown the voice of their impieties, with loud cryes for the <hi>Glory of God, for the Glory of God.</hi> As thoſe Stateſmen will break their faith and their oaths, and at the rate of their honeſty purchaſe the common welfare; ſo do theſe men tranſgreſs all Gods Laws, and will pawn their very ſouls upon it, that all is done for the Divine honour. As if God had need of mens ſin, or we could tell what is his intereſt better then himſelf. I am ſomething angry at this vile abuſe of his holy name; for I can make no better ſenſe of mens actions then this; That though God hath told us what is his m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d and pleaſure; yet they will inſtruct him and teach him what is more for his benefit, and ſhew him a way that he thought not on for the advancement of his glory.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But perhaps there is no ſuch thing as ſin in them; and we poor creatures know not the myſterie of that great phraſe <hi>Free-grace.</hi> There is a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar priviledge (that we know not of) contained in thoſe words to do evil. As if it was called <hi>Free-grace,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:170332:192"/>it made them free from all Law: or by an <hi>Antiphraſis,</hi> becauſe it makes them ſlaves to all their own luſts and worldly affections. And indeed it is very ſtrange if God ſhould be ſo <hi>free</hi> and liberall as to give a way all his own rights, and let his creatures do even as they liſt. If men ſwallow once this conceit, they will not be ſo kind as to give him any thing back again.

It is the fault of the world, that they carp at the failings of good men when they
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:170332:193"/>are alive, and take no notice of their piety and holineſs: and yet they will imitate thoſe failings when they are dead, and think to cruſt over all their ſins by thoſe Examples which they would have railed at before. If Vice be ugly, then it is moſt ill favoured in thoſe who are good: and if theſe men were good, they would be of that judgement. And as the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> brought their children to behold their ſlaves when they were drunk, not that they might learn of them, but that they might abhor that dirty and ſottiſh ſin: ſo would theſe men look upon the ſins of others, not to be like them and do the ſame, but the more to abominate and deteſt them which leave ſuch a foul blemiſh upon them that commit them. And at the day of judgement, they will be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, not only for ſinning, but for falling into thoſe ſins which they had fair warning to watch againſt by the Examples of others before them.</p>
               <p n="10">10. You muſt come near therefore to thoſe that make a fair ſhew, and examine their actions, before you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

If you ſtand at a diſtance from them, you would take them to be very glorious Saints: they do ſo glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in an outward profeſſion, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſuch ſplendid works of devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but if you come near to them and handle them, you will find them hot without, and cold within: full of fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and violence in their external mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but void of all true love and goodneſs in their hearts. I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times compared them in my own thoughts unto thoſe Indian Calicoes, which when we behold afarr off ſeem to be a rare needlework of all ſorts of ſilk: but when we come cloſe to them are only thin painted ſtuff that hath neitheir ſubſtance, nor coſt in it. Theſe men look like the Kings daughter, whoſe garments were of needle work, and wrought gold, whereby you would imagine that they were all <hi>glorious within</hi> alſo: but if you come to deal with them, you ſhall ſee by many of their actions, that this outward brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is a meer varniſh and gloſs that they
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:170332:194"/>ſet upon themſelves: ſome painted raiment to hide their nakedneſs, but which an obſervant eye may eaſily look thorough, it is ſo thin and beggerly.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Eſpecially obſerve how many of them change with times and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſay that they muſt follow Providence. If you follow them cloſe, you will ſoon find that as their profit leads them, ſo they cry up particular pieces of godlineſs. Juſt like <hi>Alcibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades,</hi> who (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith of a flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer) at <hi>Athens</hi> was a gallant,<note place="margin">De diſcrim. adul. &amp; amic.</note> and at <hi>Sparta</hi> wore a thred-bare cloak; in <hi>Thracia</hi> was a warrier, and at <hi>Tiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherne</hi> gave himſelf to pride and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; So do theſe men vary according as ſeveral humours ſtir within them. Sometimes they would have all Gods people be no leſs then <hi>Kings;</hi> and at other times they muſt be as poor as <hi>beggars.</hi> Sometimes they pine and macerate themſelves with faſting, and again they think that none but they may make a free uſe of the creature. Many of them there are that will ſail with every wind if it blow them any profit; and all of them are carried as
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:170332:195"/>the fierce guſts of their various paſſions do make a zealous bluſter in them. But a good man who directs his life, not by his worldly intereſt, or mutable fancies, but by the word of God, he alwayes ſteers the ſame courſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains conſtantly the ſame man, as that word doth, <hi>whoſe righteouſneſs is everlaſting.</hi> We may ſay of him, as the ſame <hi>Plutarch</hi> doth of thoſe brave men <hi>Epimanondas</hi> and <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi>

               <p n="12">12. And if any of theſe men we have been treating of, be ſo hardy as to ſuffer for their <hi>Opinion</hi> (for I can call it nothing elſe) and not alway caſt to be on the thriving ſide, yet it is with a full bad will. And they are ſo far from bearing it meekly and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, that they ſtruggle by all means
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:170332:195"/>to throw the croſs from off their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. If there be any way to eaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they inquire not much whether it be good or bad, but are eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to think that <hi>Providence</hi> makes an offer to them for their deliverance, though it be by unlawfull means. Such as they would not have ſpared <hi>Saul,</hi> if they had been in <hi>Davids</hi> caſe when he had him at his mercy, but they would have applauded <hi>Abiſhai</hi> for a Saint, who ſaid, <hi>God hath delivered thine enemy into thy hand,</hi> and bidden him ſmite him to the ground. And obſerve them alſo when they are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt again, whether they be not as zealous to lay the croſs on other mens ſhoulders, as they were to caſt it from off their own. As far as I can obſerve, it is the temper of this <hi>falſe zeal</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it is, to endure no oppreſſion quietly, to endeavour alway to be above, to trample upon others, to be proud and diſobedient, to contemn all authoriy which is not on their ſide, and to ſpeak evil of dignities, if they do not ſpeak well of them.</p>

               <p n="6">6. For, Religion conſiſts not only in acts of worſhip, whereby men may ſmooth their faces and give them a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial gloſs: but in the through ſcowring of their ſouls from all evil habits which ſtick ſo faſt unto them.
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:170332:202"/>It makes us not only to bow our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and ſtudy the neater and more complementall performances: but to undertake the rougher and ſeverer du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to bow our ſouls before God, and to purge our hearts from all that is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to his eyes, and hinders him from embracing of us. <q>Where the Goſpell comes in truth (ſaith <hi>Eraſmus</hi> very well,) it makes peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple more obedient to their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,<note place="margin">In praefat. ad ſuum Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſt.</note> more obſervant of the Laws: Lovers of Peace, and haters of War: Husbands and wives agree better, children are more obedient to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and ſervants to Maſters: no workman but performs his task with greater fidelity, nor tradeſman but doth as he would be done by: and to ſpeak in a word, all men will become more kind, and ſlow to revenge: leſs greedy of the world, and more ſober in the enjoyment of it.</q>

A peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that ſhould by contempt of the world attain a felicity that others ſeek after by enjoying of it. A people of a ſingle eye, ignorant of all envy, malice and ſpite. That ſhould be void of all luſt, and meditating an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical life in this fleſh. Not make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divorces, as being a people that could either mend any thing, or elſe bear it. That ſhould not ſwear, as not diſtruſting nor deceiving any: That ſhould not ſeek after money, as having their treaſures in heaven. That ſhould not be tickled with vain glory, as referring all to the glory of Chriſt their Saviour. That ſhould not be ambitious, as knowing the greater they were, the more they ſhould do for Chriſt; and the lower, they ſhould ſubmit to all for his ſake. That ſhould not be angry when provoked, or give ill language, much leſs take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:170332:203"/>as being men that muſt return good for evil. That muſt be of ſuch an innocent life, that heathens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhould approve of them.

That ſhould perfectly agree among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as members one of another. That ſhould do all Chriſtian offices one for another, helping others in need, bearing of their burdens, or making them lighter by their officious love.

That ſhould fear neither tyranny, nor Death, nor the Devil himſelf, truſting in Chriſt only. That ſhould alwayes be ready to die, and give an account. This is the ſcope of Chriſts doctrine, and ſuch men we are to labour more and more that we may grow. <hi>Haec ſunt authoris noſtri dogmata nova, quae nulla Philoſophorum familia tradidit.

He was ſo innocent, that the falſe witneſſes who were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned for the purpoſe, could not tell how handſomely to accuſe him. He was ſo meek, that he was led like a ſheep to the ſlaughter. So free he was from covetouſneſs, that he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor affected any thing that we can hear of. He was ſo humble, that he waſhed his diſciples feet. So free from ambition, that he would not be made a King when the people would have crowned him. He ſtuck not to die the death of the Croſs. When they buffeted him, he returned not their ſtroaks; when he was revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, he reviled not again; when he ſuffered, he threatned not, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelf to the righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. <hi>And hereunto are we called,</hi>

               <p>All this that I have ſaid from him, may be thus reduced into ſome order, by conſidering that our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion teaches us to croſs all our own deſires, and to be wholly at the will of our Lord and maſter. <hi>To believe what he reveals, and to obey what he commands; to fear only what he threatens, and to hope for nothing but what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</hi> And our <hi>Deſires</hi> being either <hi>ſinfull</hi> or only <hi>natural,</hi> it teaches us to deny our ſelves in both.

<pb n="398" facs="tcp:170332:205"/>thoſe that read the Scripture ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, from minding theſe things; but by making them look upon it as a Book that teaches them to be <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> rather then <hi>good,</hi> to <hi>diſpute</hi> rather then to <hi>live.</hi> And thus the <hi>Phariſees</hi> cozened themſelves, who ſtudied this Holy Writ to make them ſubtile and wiſe, very curious and nice about ſeveral caſes that might be argued in the ceremonial Law: but they did not look upon it as a Book that ſhould make them like to him that made it. There they learnt to oppoſe the <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces</hi> who denied another life; more then they did to attain that life by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and ſubduing all their luſts. And ſo at this day men read the Scriptures to defend their opinions, to uphold their cauſe, to ſee if they will be on their ſide, and to make them able to oppoſe all adverſaries. And then ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that it ſounds altogether that way that they would have it, they come to be as zealous and fierce for their opinion as other men are for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly living: and no man can urge a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine command more peremptorily,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:170332:205"/>then they will do their doubtfull Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.

But while they <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute</hi> of God, they do <hi>not know</hi> him; and while they wrangle about <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> they remain <hi>unſanctified;</hi> and while they contend about the extent of Chriſts redemption, they take care that themſelves ſhall have no great benefit by it. Juſt as the Philoſophers diſputed about the nature of <hi>Honeſty,</hi> while they ſhould have lived honeſtly; &amp; ſpent their time in debating what the Form of Vertue was, while they ſhould have done vertuouſly: So do men now diſpute about the nature of <hi>Faith, Hope and Charity,</hi> till they leave themſelves no time to exerciſe and put in practice any of them.

               <p n="10">10. All thoſe therefore who are ſubject to this diſeaſe (which I doubt
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:170332:206"/>is too common) muſt mind the true end for which God gave us this Holy Book, which was not to fill our heads with curious Notions, but our hearts with holy and devout affections: not to teach us nice and ſubtill diſtinctions, but to tell us plainly how to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh beeween good and evil: not to make us able combatants againſt all opinions that ſwarm in the world: but to arm us againſt all the luſts of the fleſh which moſt abound, and war moſt againſt the ſoul. And we muſt have no other end in ſtudying of this divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but <hi>ut mutemur, ut rapiamur, ut af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flemur, ut transformemur in ea quae diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> that we may be changed, that we may be rapt and ſnatcht away from our ſelves, that we may receive the breath of heaven, that we may be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into the things that we learn. And then we have profited much, not when we can diſpute more ſharply, but when we can live more exactly; not when our wits are more acute, but when our hearts are more dull to all earthly things: not when we are more confident of our knowledge, but when
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:170332:206"/>we are leſs proud, angry, covetous, voluptuous, and ſubject to any other vice. This kind of Philoſophy (as the ſame <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſpeaks) is <hi>in affectibus ſitum verius quam in ſyllogiſmis;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Paracleſi.</note>

Thou ſhalt find both Doctrines and Examples giving thee an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute form of life, and inſtructing thee how to be as good as thou canſt deſire. But if thou readeſt the Scripture only to fight againſt others, not thy ſelf; to ſatisfie thy mind in diſputable points rather then to know the unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:170332:207"/>wayes of holineſs: and intendeſt to expreſs what thou knoweſt rather in ſyllogiſms then in thy life; and good talk rather then good deeds; thou art not like to be a Chriſtian. The divine ſpirit loves not to dwell in contentious ſouls: Truth uſes not to be found in the midſt of a ſcuffle; nor loves ſhe to lie in a mind that is ſet round only with thorny notions and perplexed diſtinctions. Study therefore how to live the life of God; become a Babe, and bring a lowly mind: or elſe a worſe thing will come of it then thy being deceived. For the world will be filled with a noiſe of Religion without any ſubſtance of it, and it will be embroiled with a factious zeal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of ſpending mens ſelves for Jeſus Chriſt.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. YOU have ſeen what <hi>whited ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres</hi> the Phariſees were, and what a goodly appearance they made in the outſide, when they were no better then charnel houſes or rather ſtinking graves within. And now for a Concluſion of this Diſcourſe you may obſerve, That thoſe <hi>Sepulchres</hi> to which our Saviour compares them were <hi>Whited</hi> on purpoſe,<note place="margin">Mat. 23.27.</note> that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might ſee them before they came
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:170332:208"/>near to them, and ſo take heed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing defiled and polluted by them. For the Jews (as a very learned man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) thought themſelves to be made unclean by touching of a grave as well as of a dead carkaſe;<note place="margin">V. Pocock. Not. Miſcell. in Port.

And juſt ſo doth our Saviour point out the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in their colours; both that men might take heed how they dealt with them, and that they might avoid their hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical temper, not taking that for godlineſs which had ſo much ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret wickedneſs lurking under it.</p>
               <p>And for the ſame reaſon it is that I have treated thus particularly of the falſe Religion that is among us: that ſo all men ſeeing wherein <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> doth conſiſt, may fly away from it, as the Jews did from a dead body or a grave; and may walk in the plain
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:170332:208"/>old path of all reall and unfeigned holineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And conſidering that this was my end, I hope none that reads me will be ſo prophane as to make uſe of all that hath been ſaid to the diſhonour of Religion, and the defaming of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous people.

Theſe things men ought to do, and not to leave the reſt undone. And <hi>except our righteouſneſs ſhall exceed the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Scribes and Phariſees,</hi>

There was never any name given to a bad party of profeſſours, but the moſt holy and ſevere perſons have by ſuch men been branded and ſtigmatized with it. <hi>A Phariſee</hi> in their mouths ſhall extend ſo far as to be a nickname for all that are <hi>ſtrictly pious;</hi> and an <hi>hypocrite</hi> is in their language a man who will not be ſo <hi>profane</hi> as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

I look upon them as fitter to be corrected and amended by whips and ſtocks then by ſober and pious books. Their whole
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:170332:209"/>life is one continued debauch, and they have no leiſure to be ſeriouſly conſiderate. Their minds are ſo ſopt in drink, that they have left no room to ſuck in any of theſe inſtructions.

But ſome of theſe there are, who have not yet ſinned away all tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that let devotion take its turn, and hope by ſuch good moods and fits to make an excuſe to God for all their looſneſs and prophaneſs.

<pb n="408" facs="tcp:170332:210"/>have them to cover their injuſtice and uncharitableneſs. All their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and faſtings are as weak and ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to the rendering of them ſober, as the ſame things are in others to the making of them righteous. And yet they perhaps take themſelves to be no leſs pious, and that with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, if not violent hatred, of all others, then the moſt ceremonious Phariſee that ever breathed. Let them therefore either reform and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new men, or elſe not take it ill if we call them <hi>prophane hypocrites,</hi> as they call others <hi>Phariſaicall.</hi> The Apoſtle puts them together with the other into one catalogue, and bids them not be deceived; <hi>for neither for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators nor idolators, nor adulterers, nor effeminate,</hi>

But they
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:170332:212"/>alſo muſt conſider that truth hath a natural congruity in it to a rational mind: and that there is a certain plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which a meer earthly man may percieve from the apt repreſentations which are made of things to his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding faculty. As the eye is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with well mixt colours: and the ear is gratified with ſounds of a ſweet compoſure: So is the mind of man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licately touched with wiſe diſcourſes, which report truths in any handſome order unto it. If theſe things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fall in with the ſenſe and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of any mans ſoul, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but tickle him with ſome delight; This picture of the Jewiſh hypocrite which I have drawn, if it be but true though not exact, will preſent him that looks upon it with ſome pleaſure. But let not any man think that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is pious, becauſe he delights in pious Treatiſes: for this may be but a natural ſatisfaction: and it is alſo one of the deceits which I have given a touch of, to be warm againſt a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which is contrary to our ſelves, and to be excited unto ſome indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:170332:212"/>on againſt that which is plainly falſe.</p>
               <p>I ſhall add no more but my earneſt prayers to God, and my requeſt to the Reader, that theſe things may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood and improved to the end for which they were written: <hi>The advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an impartial reſpect to all Gods Commandments, and the hating of every falſe way.</hi> Unto which alſo the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Sermon is purpoſely addreſſed.</p>
